        (e) the number of Australian women killed by their partners each year has not changed significantly in over 30 years;

        (iv) fully fund proven programs that save lives, such as 'Staying Home Leaving Violence', which been shown by research to be an effective contributor to the long-term safety and housing stability of women and children who have left a violent and abusive relationship; and

       <p class="italic">
