         Thanks to the member for Aston for her question but also for caring so deeply about people in her community looking for affordable properties, and particularly the renters in her part of the world.

        <p>
         We'd a really important development today, as the Senate cleared the way for the next stage of the consideration of the Housing Australia Future Fund, and we thank those in the Senate who were prepared to support the HAFF so that we could get this moving. This is the biggest single investment in social housing since the member for Sydney was the housing minister over a decade ago, and it is part of a broad and ambitious agenda that we have for housing. It's an important part of our housing plan, but it's not the only part of our housing plan.

           On top of the Housing Australia Future Fund, across our first two budgets, this government and this Prime Minister have committed in excess of $8 billion in new funding to deliver more houses, more supply and more relief for renters, because we want more Australians to have the security and the dignity of a decent home and a decent roof over their head. Yesterday, the Minister for Housing launched the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council's report into barriers to institutional investment in housing, and that report sets out a range of ways that we can help get more investment in housing in this country, but we are already taking a number of steps across a number of fronts. We are working with the states and local government—

               and that applies to people struggling to find a roof over their head as well. This is a longstanding challenge, but we are taking decisive action across a range of areas. We have had a wasted decade when it comes to investment in housing, and we are doing our best to turn that around and to clean up the mess that we inherited. We are working to get more homes, more supply, making it easier to own a home, and also taking some of the sting out of these higher rents, with the biggest increase in Commonwealth rent assistance in three decades. We know, of course, there is more work to be done, but this is a government which is working for Australia, delivering billions of dollars as investment in housing, building more homes and more supply and helping to ease the pressure on renters. That's why, despite all of that effort, it beggars belief that, in the Senate today, those opposite voted for fewer homes and more homelessness and higher rents. We are cleaning up the mess they left behind.
