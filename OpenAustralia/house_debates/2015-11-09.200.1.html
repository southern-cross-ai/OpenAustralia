        On Thursday last week I officially opened the Belmont Community Child Care Centre's extension. This is a childcare centre that has been operating in the Belmont area for 26 years. It is run by the community. It has fantastic outcomes. Walking into that centre on Thursday, the one thing that struck me was just how happy all of the children were. Not one child was crying. I went outside to the area that has been extended, a whole new section. The 'kangaroo room' has been added, with a fantastic outdoor area. The outdoor area has a number of activities—water activities and little stepping stones. It is a drawing room that is accessible from both the outdoor and the indoor areas. The children were enjoying the activities they could undertake there.
       </p>

        I would like to thank the staff at the childcare centre and to congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Macquarie City Council
        </a>
        for the support they have given to the Belmont Community Child Care Centre and Daracon Engineering for the work they have undertaken on the site. What they have achieved is something that is going to benefit so many young people into the future. This is a centre that is light and airy and provides quality care for the children in Belmont and surrounding areas.
