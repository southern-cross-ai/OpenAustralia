       <p class="italic">
        (d) the independent panel appointed by the Minister to consult with stakeholders and provide advice on how and when the Government will phase out exports provided its report to the Minister on 25 October 2023;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) despite numerous requests, the Government and the Minister have refused to release the report to stakeholders, famers or industry groups, claiming it is 'cabinet-in-confidence';

        (f) the Coalition's Agriculture, Water and Environment Backbench Committee met with livestock farmers in

        (2) condemns the Government for its reckless and ideological decision to forcibly shut down Australia's live sheep export industry in order to try and hold seats in the inner cities where they are competing with the

        in the House on Wednesday, 14 February 2024 in regard to 'parents who just cannot afford to buy the groceries they need for their families... parents who are struggling terribly with rents... people who can't afford to fill their car up with petrol';
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) further notes comments in the CommBank iQ Cost of Living Insights Report for November 2023 that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) Australians are spending more on essentials such as insurance, medical costs and pharmacies, leaving less funds for purchase of discretionary items such as household goods and clothing; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) younger Australians between 25 and 29 years old have been the hardest hit with a 5.1 per cent decline in their total spending, the only age group to decrease both discretionary and essential spending;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) recognises that under the Government:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the costs of food, housing, electricity, insurance and gas have all increased;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) real spending power has been reduced; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) younger Australians, with and without children, are being especially impacted by rising living costs;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) condemns the Government for the current cost of living crisis which is due to the Government's mismanagement of the economy and failure to adequately address high inflation and increased interest rates; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) calls on the Government to immediately develop and implement sensible economic policies to address Australia's cost of living crisis which is hurting all Australians.

        SHEEP EXPORT: Resumption of debate on the motion of Mr Ramsey—That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) Australia's live sheep export industry employs more than 3,500 people in Western Australia and is worth $85 million in direct payments to producers with an assumed multiplier effect close to $300 million;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) Australia has developed world-leading animal welfare standards which are applied to animals exported by sea and the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System ensures animal welfare right through to point of slaughter in destination markets;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Government have committed to phasing out live sheep exports from Australia, but have not released a timeframe for this;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the independent panel appointed by the Minister to consult with stakeholders and provide advice on how and when the Government will phase out exports provided its report to the Minister on 25 October 2023;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) despite numerous requests, the Government and the Minister have refused to release the report to stakeholders, famers or industry groups, claiming it is 'cabinet-in-confidence';
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) the Coalition's Agriculture, Water and Environment Backbench Committee met with livestock farmers in South Australia and Western Australia from 5 to 8 March to hear firsthand the concerns of those in the region most likely to be affected;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) the committee heard from farmers, industry participants and community representatives who work hard to ensure the welfare of their animals throughout the export process is maintained at the high levels Australians expect; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (h) attendees at eight meetings over four days indicated that confidence in the sheep industry was at its lowest point in decades and were fearful for the industry's future and the future of family farms and businesses and their wider rural communities
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) condemns the Government for its reckless and ideological decision to forcibly shut down Australia's live sheep export industry in order to try and hold seats in the inner cities where they are competing with the Australian Greens;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) recognises that any decisions made in respect to the trade should always be predicated on science and independent of the Government;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) calls on the Government to urgently explain what factual evidence or science its decision to ban the live sheep export industry is based on;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) demands the Government to immediately release the report of the independent panel to allow proper discussion with stakeholders; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) urges the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to urgently re-open the inquiry into the grooming of and payments made to Faizal Ullah by Animals Australia in the light of a second statutory declaration coming forward after the closure of its initial investigation.

        <i>
         from 18 March 2024

        ) on the motion of Ms Byrnes—That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government's expanded Home
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarantee" rel="nofollow">
         Guarantee
        </a>
        Scheme has now supported more than 100,000 people into home ownership since the election, bringing home ownership back into reach;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) almost one in three first home buyers in 2022-23 were supported by the scheme, a significant increase from the previous year under the former Government;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Government delivered on its commitment to introduce the new Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee three months ahead of schedule in October 2022, and it has assisted more than 15,000 people across regional Australia into home ownership; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the Government has also expanded eligibility of the Home Guarantee Scheme to help more Australians who were locked out under the previous Government into home ownership;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government wants to provide even more support for people to own their home through the Help to Buy scheme, which is due to start later this year following the passage of state legislation; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) Help to Buy will support eligible home buyers with an equity contribution of up to 40 per cent for new homes and 30 per cent for existing homes, with eligible buyers needing as little as a 2 per cent deposit to buy a home; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) further notes that the Home Guarantee Scheme and Help to Buy are just two parts of the Government's broad and ambitious housing agenda, with the Government committing funding of $25 billion in new housing investments over the next decade including committed funding to support thousands of new social and affordable rentals, with many already under construction.

       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that under its Inflation Reduction Act, the United States of America (USA) has committed more than one trillion (AUD) in incentives to accelerate the USA's transition to net zero by 2050;

        (3) further notes that business representatives have raised concerns that Australia is lagging in the race to decarbonise, in part due to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) unwieldly state and federal approvals processes;
