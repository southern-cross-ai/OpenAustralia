          We're back to where we were yesterday. It's the same point of order that I took yesterday. Whether a statement has been made outside the House or inside the House, the rules in
          <i>
           Practice
          </i>
          are the same when it refers to something before somebody became a minister. It is that the question has to be about the statement. It can't simply be a reference to the statement and then a question about something else. Exactly the problem that arose yesterday arises with this question, only it's about a statement inside the House rather than outside. The
          <i>
           Practice
          </i>
          treats the two identically when it refers to something where the event itself occurred prior to the person becoming a minister.

           I'm going to ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to rephrase the question to make sure it is within standing orders. These questions are problematic. I'm just going to ask her to make sure that she's either referring directly to a comment or quote within the statement so that it can be relevant. To simply refer to the statement and ask something else is not within the standing orders. So I'd just ask her to rephrase the question to make sure it is relevant.

            Mr Speaker, may I address your ruling. To your ruling: yesterday, the question was eventually ruled in order. There is a longstanding convention that questions can be asked about answers that were given in question time the day before or at any other previous time. This question refers to public statements that the minister has made and answers that she gave yesterday relating to those public statements, and at the heart of the question are her answers from yesterday. I ask that you rule the question in order.

                  Mr Speaker, in the previous parliament a very similar situation arose where a question was asked of a minister in relation to what the minister had said previously. That was the subject of some deliberation, and the then Manager of Opposition Business had this to say:

                   The difficulty I have, as I explained to the House yesterday, is that, whilst a minister may give a remark or statement to the House, she can be questioned about those words. You can't add extra things on to that statement about information you may wish to have or undertake, because the minister was not responsible at the time. She's responsible for her words and actions since she's been a minister but also in the House. I'll give the Deputy Opposition Leader one more time to rephrase the question, not to add another question into a statement that she answered yesterday. It's got to be about the statement. It is very narrow about what she can ask.

                    My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Water. I refer to the minister's answers in question time yesterday where she said:

                    . When did the minister first become aware of these allegations?
