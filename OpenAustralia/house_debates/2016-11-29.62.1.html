        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Can the minister update the House on the steps that the government is taking to ensure the effective management of the 457 visa program? And how does this compare to any other approaches?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. It is one of great achievements of this government that we have created half a million jobs since we have come into government. That is something that all Australians should be very proud of. We are working hard to get Australians into work and to get our economy pumping right across the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 457 visa program enables employers to employ a foreign worker if the position cannot be filled by an Australian worker.

             We saw yesterday that that

               Daily Telegraph
              </a>
             </i>
             had a story in relation to the Leader of the Opposition. He claimed to be the great friend of the Australian worker and to put Australian workers first, but, as it turned out, the Leader of the Opposition, when he was in government as the employment minister, had signed off on special deal for
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's" rel="nofollow">
              McDonald's
             </a>
             and

              KFC
             </a>
             to employ foreign workers over Australian workers. So we have seen example after example over the course of the last 12 months or so of this Leader of the Opposition being completely untrustworthy. You cannot trust a word that this Leader of the Opposition says. He says one thing in here and something very different when he gets outside.
            </p>
            <p>
             The difficulty for the Leader of the Opposition is that his hypocrisy does not just stop with the agreement for McDonald's. As the foreign minister pointed out before, the Leader of the Opposition was out there railing against the free trade agreement with the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Republic" rel="nofollow">
              People's Republic
             </a>
             of China when the reality was he was doing something very different when he was the employment minister. He was out there saying that he wanted to put Australians first. Yet, we have seen in the
             <i>
              Daily Tele
             </i>
             today that the then employment minister, the now Leader of the Opposition—

                The minister will resume his seat. The minister will refer to members by their correct titles. I have warned him on this before. The member for Isaacs can just relax for a second. It will be okay. You are going to get the call. I have cautioned the minister on this before. There is a ruling that I refer members to. I will be taking further action for recidivists on the subject. We are not just going to keep asking the minister to withdraw. He will force me to take further action if it persists.
