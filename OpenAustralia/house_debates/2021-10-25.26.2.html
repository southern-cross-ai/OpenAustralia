       </p>
       <p>
        As we approach 29 November, I take the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the Palestinian people and stand united in their struggle for self-determination. When the Oslo agreements were drafted in 1993, they were intended to give the Palestinian people autonomy. However, 28 years later the military occupation continues to control the lives of Palestinians and their access to the basic necessities of life, including the vital water supply. Under the Oslo agreements, Israel retains exclusive control over almost all the water resources. The agreements allocate 80 per cent of the mountain aquifer water to Israeli use and 20 per cent to the Palestinians. Apart from the human rights implications that arise, it is quite concerning given that over the last 28 years the Palestinian population of the occupied
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         West Bank
        </a>
        has nearly doubled. Due to these restrictions, the Palestinian authority is forced to purchase significant water supply from Mekorot, Israel's national water company. This issue is further complicated by the very poor Palestinian water pipelines, which mean that about a third of the water supply, I am advised, is being lost to leakage. The water shortage in the West Bank is acute in summer and Mekorot restricts the water supplies for the higher demands of the Israeli settlements. As a result, the average water consumption for all Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza falls well behind the World Health Organization's recommended minimum levels. Access to necessities such as water is an inalienable human right and, unfortunately, these rights are not being realised due to military occupation. Clearly this is inhumane and unjust. We must work towards affording self-determination to the Palestinian people, including a future that's based on peace, dignity, justice and security.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge there are many obstacles in the ongoing peace process, particularly the need for urgent action in respect to settlements, Jerusalem, the Gaza blockade and the humanitarian situation in the occupied territories. I believe it falls to countries like Australia, who believe in the dignity of all people, to become more engaged in addressing the need for a tangible process towards the creation of the Palestinian state while ensuring respect and security for a Jewish homeland.
       </p>
       <p>
        I genuinely accept the right of the Jewish state to exist and for it to be able to defend the rights and freedoms of its people. However, I firmly believe the future of the Jewish state and, indeed, the region depends on Israel's ability to live in peace with its neighbours, including a Palestinian state. On this note, I call on the government to ensure that Australia's working constructively to support security and the human rights of Palestinians, including the unequivocal commitment to adjust an enduring two-state solution consistent with international law.
       </p>
       <p>
        While slightly digressing, I'd also take this opportunity to reiterate my concerns about Mohammed El Halabi, the former director of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision" rel="nofollow">
         World Vision
        </a>
        Australia in Gaza and the West Bank. Mr El Halabi has been charged on allegations of funnelling $50 million of World Vision aid money to a terrorist group, Hamas. Although investigations have been conducted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs
        </a>
        , independent auditors as well as World Vision itself, they have all failed to show any evidence that money was actually diverted, Mr El Halabi remains in prison. He's been severely restricted in his legal defence throughout his four-year ordeal, depriving him of a fair trial, and has been forced to attend over 150 court appearances without any substantial evidence to support the allegations against him. I have been in contact with Mr El Halabi's distressed father on a number of occasions now regarding his son's plight and, accordingly, I use this opportunity to renew any call for the international community to continue to place pressure on Israel to finalise Mr El Halabi's trial without further delay. I look further to a future where Israel and Palestine can coexist in peace and harmony and I echo the views of

          </a>
          ; indeed, much of what he said I agree with, particularly his support for the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. I, like the Australian government and many Australians, support the notion of two states—the two peoples living alongside one another peacefully and in coexistence. Unfortunately, a peace process, one that has been engaged over many years, has not led to the establishment of a Palestinian state to date. As the member for Fowler articulated, there have been numerous obstacles. If this were easy, of course, it would have been done by now, so we shouldn't underestimate the difficulties that are involved.
         </p>
         <p>
          My enduring lesson from my time as the Australian Ambassador to Israel is that there are two things that need to happen, effectively, for peace to come about. Firstly, Israel will only make the necessary territorial concessions that are needed for peace once its security is assured. Secondly, Palestinians will only make the necessary identity concessions once the Palestinians are reconciled to Israel's existence. Both of those elements are missing to date, and have been missing throughout the process, whether it was the
