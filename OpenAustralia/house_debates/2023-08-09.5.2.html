        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) acknowledges that Australia is facing a housing crisis, with rents and house prices surging, home ownership falling, and more than 640,000 households either homeless or under housing stress;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) this crisis is severely affecting young people, those on lower incomes and renters, with advertised rents rising over ten per cent across capital cities and many regions; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the crisis is the result of decades of failed government policy, which has left Australia with one of the lowest number of homes per person in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        ;

       <p class="italic">
        (3) further acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government has taken some positive steps but its commitment to building one million new homes by 2030 is insufficient relative to the scale of the crisis; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) without substantial further action, the Australian dream will soon become a nightmare and a generation of young people will forever be locked out of home ownership; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) significantly raise its ambition on increasing housing supply;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) work with state governments and local councils to accelerate actions that increase housing and land availability, which will lead to increased home ownership and improved housing affordability; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) provide urgent support to help young people and renters deal with the cost of living pressures created by this crisis.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises that the Robodebt Scheme, which was put forward as a budget measure in 2015 and was found to be unlawful by the Federal Court in late 2019, caused great harm to vulnerable members of the Australian community;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) notes that despite the mounting warnings and criticism of the scheme, in the words of the report the Government of the time 'continued to illegally raise debts against some of society's most vulnerable';
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) commends the courage, leadership and bravery of victims, families, advocates and whistle-blowers who continued to raise concerns about the Robodebt Scheme; and

        (5) welcomes the Government's commitment to ensuring such a tragedy never happens again, and to carefully consider the recommendations from the report and provide a response to these recommendations in due course.

        (a) the Government is seeking to impose new misinformation laws in Australia which are deeply flawed;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) even before submissions closed on 20 August, the Government's exposure draft bill had already been the subject of an avalanche of criticism;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) some of the most vocal criticisms have come from leading lawyers who have clinically taken the Government's bill apart, piece by piece; and

        (d) the Minister appears to have had few defenders of her plan;

        (2) acknowledges that, under the Government's exposure draft bill:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the definition of 'misinformation' is so broad that it could capture many statements made by Australians in the context of political debate;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) authorised content by the Government cannot be misinformation, but criticisms of the Government by ordinary Australians can be misinformation;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) nothing an academic says can be misinformation, but statements by somebody disagreeing with an academic can be misinformation;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) good faith statements made by entertainers cannot be misinformation, but good faith statements made by ordinary Australians on political matters can be misinformation;

       <p class="italic">
        (e) journalists commenting on their personal digital platforms could have their content removed as misinformation; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) if the Minister has a favoured digital platform, then that platform could be entirely removed from the application of the misinformation laws;

        (3) condemns the Government for delivering this appalling exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023; and

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) the stated reason for the cancellation, the cost blowout to between $6 and 7 billion, demonstrates that the Victorian Government either made a serious miscalculation in its decision to host the games years earlier than originally proposed, or is incapable of managing major projects; and

       <p class="italic">
        (3) given the mismanagement of this major event, the $2 billion announced to be spent in regional Victoria to compensate for the loss of the games should be determined by the impacted regional communities, not the Victorian Government.

        (1) notes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the field of genetics has great potential to improve medicine and public health through enabling diagnosis, prevention and early treatment of disease;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) that increasingly, genetic information is used in routine patient care to identify individuals at risk for medically actionable conditions, and early knowledge of this risk can allow at-risk individuals to take preventive steps to reduce their risk or, in some cases, avoid developing the associated disease altogether;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the current ability of the life insurance industry to legally use genetic test results in underwriting can lead to discrimination;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) that insurance discrimination fears can also act as a barrier, by deterring people from having potentially life-saving genetic testing that could match them to tailored interventions and treatments, as well as from participation in genetic research; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) that numerous other countries have prohibited the use of genetic test results to discriminate against individuals in insurance underwriting;

       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) in 2018, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Financial Services' inquiry into the life insurance industry made recommendations relating to the use of genetic test results in life insurance underwriting, including consideration of a moratorium and potentially further legislative action or another form of regulation banning or limiting the use of predictive genetic information by the life insurance industry;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) in 2019, the Financial Services Council introduced a partial moratorium restricting member life insurance companies from requiring applicants to disclose or using applicants' genetic test results for policies below certain financial limits, which is self-regulation by industry with no government oversight; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Australian Genetics and Life Insurance Moratorium: Monitoring the Effectiveness and Response (A-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLIMMER" rel="nofollow">
         GLIMMER
        </a>
        ) Project was funded by the Government from 2020-2023 to investigate effectiveness of the moratorium as a regulatory solution to genetic discrimination in Australian life insurance, and found that discrimination fears continue to deter individuals from having genetic testing, and that the moratorium is inadequate to address and prevent genetic discrimination in life insurance;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) recognises the invaluable work of Dr Jane Tiller, Project lead,

        (4) calls on the Government to consider policy changes to address and prevent genetic discrimination in life insurance and assist patients in receiving lifesaving medical care.

        (3) recognises that local government is responsible for around 77 per cent of the road network but only collects around 3.5 per cent of the total tax revenue raised by governments in Australia, and as such is heavily reliant on road funding from other levels of government;

       <p class="italic">
        (6) calls on the Government to amend the Black Spot Road Safety Program guidelines to make it easier for the local Government sector to access that fund.
