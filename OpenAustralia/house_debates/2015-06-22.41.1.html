         I reject these opposition amendments. I want to talk about how proud I am that this government is committed to ensuring that our nation remains at the very cutting edge of initiatives in medical research. We have done and will continue to do this through ensuring that our medical researchers are on the forefront of developing technologies, treatments and research. In last year's budget, we as a government committed to the creation of a $20 billion
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research" rel="nofollow">
          Medical Research
         </a>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
          Future Fund
         </a>
         . This is, by far, the biggest endowment fund of its kind in the world and will be an asset to our nation, delivering benefits for all Australians now and well into the future. When I reflect on the initial purpose of the Medical Research Future Fund Bill 2015 and what it proposes, I think of the enormous benefits that can be delivered. This bill will fund vital research, which will enable more researchers and more scientists to discover and innovate new technologies and new medicines.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know that the Hunter Medical Research Institute, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMRI" rel="nofollow">
          HMRI
         </a>
         , encourages innovation at all levels of health and medical research and that the institute will directly benefit from the establishment of this Medical Research Future Fund, which will provide a secure and reliable revenue stream for further medical research. The fund will enable our nation to support a sustainable health system into the future. The cure to breast cancer, the cure to brain cancer, might only be a number of years in the making. A financial injection such as this, into vital research, may project to such landmark findings that will shape the future and, importantly, save lives. They may only be a few years away.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Hunter Medical Research Institute recently began a project on virtual biopsies for prostate cancer that could bring new-found accuracy in the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. This was done through the HMRI opening a magnetic resonance imaging centre, with the most advanced scanning technology in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" rel="nofollow">
          Southern Hemisphere
         </a>
         . This technology is also used for further research into early detection of breast cancer. In August 2014 it expanded into detecting prostate cancer using spectroscopy, a 'virtual biopsy'. This is at the very forefront of prostate cancer research being undertaken on such an advanced MRI scanner. This research is undertaken at the Hunter Medical Research Institute, in the

I am proud to hear of these outcomes in my patch, my home, the Hunter. The HMRI are also on the forefront with the development of a new generation of targeted melanoma drugs, with HMRI researchers' findings in this sphere likely to lead to future collaborations with the world's top cancer researchers. This news is particularly welcome and significant for the Hunter region, which has above average rates of melanoma. Cancer Institute

         for the latest innovations—just an example of how valuable this investment is for our nation and for our communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am proud of what the government is achieving in relation to advancing the scope and potential in both the research and medical fields through the Medical Research Future Fund Bill. To close, I would like to note that this bill is an investment in Australia, an investment into medical research, an investment into quality of life and, more importantly, an investment into generating a better understanding of illnesses and diseases, delivering real outcomes for saving our lives. But the work is not done for Hunter Medical Research. Institute. An investment of $93 million established the first real and meaningful building for the research. Now planning is underway to build a second tower, which will house clinical trials of some of the research, will provide greater opportunities for commercialisation of some of the research outcomes that they have delivered. Importantly, remember, this is a tripartite establishment. Our community holds the chair. It is working with the University of Newcastle and Hunter New England Health to deliver real and meaningful health outcomes for all of our nation, and indeed the world, through the work that is done there.

          I rise to speak on the amendments (9) to (21) and (23) to the

          </a>
          Bill 2015. Unfortunately, I did not get to speak during the debate as I was cut off, as I have been on numerous debates recently, by a government that is supposedly intent on letting us speak and be heard in this place about such important things as the Medical Research Future Fund.
         </p>
         <p>
          I reject this notion that the amendments are spurious, because what we have before us is a deeply concerning piece of legislation. On the whole, Labor is happy to support the notion of a Medical Research Future Fund. Indeed, I and the member for Scullin have spent the last 12 months speaking to everybody in the medical research field. We have spoken to them one on one, because we discovered that the government had announced this wonderful medical fund accounting trick—as many people have referred to it, particularly
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Gittins" rel="nofollow">

           e.
          </i>
          They mentioned the accounting trick in the budget but had not consulted with anybody. The member for Scullin and I have been out, at the request of the shadow minister for health and the member for Ballarat, Katherine King, to actually talk to people in the field. I have talked to everybody in Victoria, where there are a huge array of medical institutions and hospitals, particularly in my electorate, where there are the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_Medical_Centre" rel="nofollow">
           Monash Medical Centre
          </a>
          and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University" rel="nofollow">
           Monash University
          </a>
          . My own electorate is home to a vast array of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHMRC" rel="nofollow">
           NHMRC
          </a>
          funding and terrific work is done there. But we discovered a range of concerns and areas of issues that were not addressed in this bill.
         </p>
         <p>
          But what is more concerning is that we have had 12 months, from the last budget to now, for the government to get out there and talk about it and set up a fund that will work. What we found is that, no, they actually have not established a fund. They have just picked up what was in the Future Fund and called it medical research—badged it. That might work for other things, but this is an area where peer review is paramount and where we need standards set and we need governance. There is no governance in this legislation, so, again, it is very concerning. Without a means for oversight, for an independent advisory panel with a peer review process, and without consulting the NHMRC or even distributing funding at arm's length through the NHMRC, the government, for all intents and purposes, can direct funds from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRFF" rel="nofollow">
           MRFF
          </a>
          to any of its pet projects. It might not even need to be within the medical research area.
         </p>
         <p>
          So, yes, we are setting up a fund that is meant to go into medical research, but how are those funds being channelled? The bill is fairly silent on that. The community is concerned because, again, the government has not consulted them. If we go back to when the fund was put out in the budget, the media reports said that one of the real surprises of the budget from last year—not this year—was the creation of the Medical Research Future Fund, which was to be partly funded by the introduction of the $7
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
           GP
          </a>
          co-payment. Theoretically, that co-payment has gone, but this injected money provides an opportunity to think strategically about the role and direction of Australia's medical research effort. That effort is a really good thing to think about, and where the money is going and where it should be used—that is, in translational medicine, in health services or in mid-career research. There are a raft of areas where the medical research community is crying out for support, assistance and guidance. But, again, this bill does not give any of that guidance, support or information. Health services research was a central part of the 2013 strategic review of health and medical research, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKeon" rel="nofollow">

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
           Productivity Commission

          annual audit, which argues:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Policy-making based on good evidence is central to improving community living standards.
         </p>
         <p>
          It was also mentioned in the recent
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission" rel="nofollow">
           National Commission
          </a>

         </p>
         <p>
          So, again, there is a great need for this, but there needs to be a strategy about how we are embedding this research into the current medical facilities so that we are not just doing more of the same. But the legislation does not tell us if we are doing more of the same or if we are not. A great concern in this space was well said by
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Gustav_Nossal" rel="nofollow">

          ? This is going to make an us-and-them situation: the medical researchers will be laughing and the enabling scientists in maths, chemistry, physics and so forth will be suffering. This is not good.
         </p>
         <p>
          He said that saving the fund would give the government the chance to support the recommendations of the last McKeon committee
          <i>
           Strategic
          </i>
          <i>

          <i>
           eview of Health and Medical Research
          </i>
          . And so it would. There is a blueprint under that medical research paper done by Simon McKeon that provides a way forward, having spoken to everybody in this space and had it supported by them, that the outlines of the McKeon review should be supported, invested in and moved upon. But this legislation does not do that. It creates a fund and then says, 'Trust us; we will deliver that fund to the people who need it.' You cannot do that in such a critical area as medical research where you need good-quality peer review.

           The government does not support the amendments moved by the opposition, because they would not achieve the objective of the bill, which is to establish a fund which will provide complementary funding within the medical research sector to meet priority national needs and to address existing strategic gaps in medical research approaches. The opposition model would continue the old model of primarily funding investigator instigated work through the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHMRC" rel="nofollow">
            NHMRC
           </a>
           . When Labor was in government they commissioned the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKeon" rel="nofollow">
            McKeon
           </a>
           review, which found that Australia needs a more strategic model to get the best health results. The opposition's proposed changes to the bill would firstly place constraints on funding for medical research infrastructure and the commercialisation of medical research innovations. Secondly, the opposition's amendments would remove the ability for the government to enter into agreements with the states and territories, with corporate Commonwealth entities or with corporations. That would be a major constraint on our ability to forge the strongest possible partnerships wherever necessary to get the best health outcomes. Thirdly, the opposition's amendments would burden the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
            CEO
           </a>
           of the NHMRC with significant additional administrative responsibilities that are not practical or appropriate in the hands of that office holder. Providing the CEO of the NHMRC with such extensive powers would be inconsistent with the intent of building proper checks and balances into the legislation.

             These are important amendments in the context of massive cuts to the Health portfolio under this government—cuts of more than $60 billion to hospitals that over time will have a devastating impact, an inevitable impact on emergency department waiting times and elective surgery waiting times. Labor's opposition to the abolition of the Health and Hospitals Fund and the transfer of the remaining $1 billion is consistent with our longstanding position that we will support health and medical research, but not if it happens and is funded in a way that hurts the patients of today.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Health and Hospitals Fund has delivered significant benefit across Australia based on the clearest possible advice of experts. Unlike the way in which this government has drafted this bill, Labor established the Health and Hospitals Fund with proper governance and proper oversight. When Labor introduced the Nation-Building Funds Act in 2008—the act that established the Health and Hospitals Fund, among others—we also established an advisory board with oversight of the Health and Hospitals Fund.

            <p>
             I particularly want to make some mention of some of the projects that have been delivered under this fund and the positive impact that the fund has had on the health and wellbeing of Australians. I want to acknowledge the 24 regional cancer centres delivered across three rounds of the fund, including in areas where, up to the time of their opening, patients had to travel many hundreds and sometimes thousands of kilometres to receive the best quality treatment for cancer. I refer in this regard to the services constructed in Townsville, Traralgon, Ballarat, Bunbury, and Whyalla in my state of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

             </a>
             , among others.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Health and Hospitals Fund also contributed to countless other projects of significant value to communities across the country, including the Garvan St Vincent's Campus Cancer Centre in Sydney, the Nepean Clinical School, the Melbourne Neuroscience Project, the new rehabilitation unit at
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Stanley_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
              Fiona Stanley Hospital

             in Perth, the Midland Health Campus in Perth, the Acute Medical and Surgical Services Unit in Launceston, and the research and training facility at the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin, among many others. It is obvious that the Health and Hospitals Fund has had a significant benefit. This is something that should not be lost as a result of this government's broken promises and through its ongoing cuts to health funding.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Prime Minister did of course promise before the last election that there would be no cuts to health. In opposing the abolition of the Health and Hospitals Fund, Labor is at least holding the government to account on the program in this area.

              would have an adverse effect on the earnings of the fund. I am bewildered; I am surprised—I do not understand. I am getting a message all through the debate on this legislation that, for some reason, Labor are not broadly in support of medical research, because if they were they would not be moving amendments like this.

              The Health and Hospitals Fund is largely uncommitted. It is not currently being used for a health purpose. The Health and Hospitals Fund was always intended to be a time limited fund which would eventually be exhausted; unlike the

              , which will exist in perpetuity. The MRFF allows the balance of these funds to be used for health purposes. It is not taking away the characterisation of these funds as being for health; it is far wider and more strategic than what the

              . I know he is representing the shadow minister and I appreciate that he is delivering the shadow minister's message, but let's not forget the origin of the Health and Hospitals Fund. This is not money that Labor had at its disposal, or that it created out of the goodness of its heart. This money derived from Peter Costello's Future Fund. It was an investment in perpetuity for the future. Labor took the earnings from the Future Fund and created a new fund called the Health and Hospitals Fund at a time when previous Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was trying a dramatic take-over of the hospital system.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is no doubt that good projects have been funded, no doubt at all; and we do not back away from that. But the question for governments and the question for this parliament is: what is the most effective use of this money going into the future? The value that we place on medical research is not the value that Labor places on medical research. Remember they tried to take out $400 million from the budget for medical research in 2011, and then they were embarrassed into a backflip. There was a sneaky accounting trick—I think, in the last of their budgets—around another $110 million, proving categorically that they are no friend of medical research and that their measures in opposing our sensible legislation are not appreciated and not supported.
