         First World War
        </a>
        , in 1914, saw for the first time Australia, as its own nation, enter a major conflict. Volunteers rushed to enlist in this seemingly exciting war that was expected to be over by Christmas. Many of these volunteers were from the Goldstein community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first independent military operation carried out by Australia was the occupation of

       </p>
       <p>
        For four more terribly long years Australians found themselves battling a war in which 60,000 Australians were killed and 156,000 more were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner. It was not until the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918 that the guns finally felt silent on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
         Great War
        </a>
        . Every year on the anniversary of this important moment we come together as a nation to commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrifice for the love of our country and the freedoms that we strive to uphold and honour. And we continue to honour them.

        Today it is our turn to stand proud and tall in remembering and honouring the service and sacrifice of all who fought for our country and those who will do so in future in defence of our freedom. We are eternally grateful for their sacrifice and their preparedness to put a love of country ahead of themselves. For that we must always remember the eternal words 'lest we forget'.

          I second the motion. I rise to emphasise the importance of the nation's moment of reflection at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month every year.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
           Remembrance Day
          </a>
          is the day we commemorate the end of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
           World War I
          </a>
          and the loss of over 60,000 Australian lives. Our thoughts go to those 16,900 Australians who remain unknown or unaccounted for on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front" rel="nofollow">
           Western Front
          </a>
          , those whose memories we honour and continue to honour through the body of an unknown Australian soldier laid to rest in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_of_Memory" rel="nofollow">
           Hall of Memory
          </a>
          . Every community in Australia has its own story, its own legacy and its own connection to the men and women who served and sacrificed in World War I.
         </p>
         <p>
          The electorate of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
           McEwen
          </a>
          has one of the oldest and longest military histories in Australia. I work closely with our community to uphold the legacy founded in McEwen ensuring that we remember our rich military heritage. On Remembrance Day last year, the World War 1 memorial park at the Seymour District Memorial Hospital was unveiled after extensive efforts to preserve and refurbish it. We worked with the Seymour
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
           RSL
          </a>
          to redo the gates at the entrance to the beautiful park. The park brings together people from all over the region including 11-year-old Sarah Moad whose poem sits proudly on a bronze plaque in front of a lone pine. I had the privilege of reading Sarah's poem in this chamber recently and was amazed by her bold words in honouring Lone Pine.
         </p>
         <p>
          McEwen is home to so many reminders of our Australian soldiers, with our Vietnam Veterans Commemorative Walk, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Horse" rel="nofollow">
           Light Horse
          </a>
          Memorial Park and the almost completed Craigieburn Centennial Park making just a few of our memorials. Of course, we cannot forget our military training facilities at Puckapunyal in Seymour which have served Australia for over a hundred years. Seymour has a military history starting back in the late 1800s and it continues to be its crowning glory even today. The Seymour camp was used as a training, holding, isolation and overflow camp during the build-up of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Imperial_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Imperial Force
          </a>
          . The camp was used throughout World War I to form and reinforce both infantry battalions and Light Horse regiments. The men of the 8th
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Horse_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
           Light Horse Regiment
          </a>
          became soldiers in Seymour before sacrificing themselves on the Nek at the attack in Gallipoli.
         </p>
         <p>
          Some of those troops whose legacy lives on through the story of the charge of Beersheba in 1917 started their journeys in Seymour. To anyone who has had the chance to go to Beersheba and see the graves that are there, it really sticks in your throat when you start looking at young boys from the ages of 16 right through to men in their 40s lying in graves a long way from home, and I guess a long way from where they planned to be in their lives—I do not think anyone expects to go to war and not come home. This is a magnificent place of reflection and I appreciated the opportunity to go there and have a look for myself. As I said, the Seymour camp served as our largest military base in Victoria until Puckapunyal was built before the beginning of World War
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
           II
          </a>
          . So both of these locations were at the heart of Victorian and Australian military training making McEwen home to so many soldiers past, present and into the future.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have been lucky to be part of this history, observing a one hundred year strong friendship between the French towns of Villers-Bretonneux and our own town of Strathewen. On April 24 1918, 1,200 brave Australians fought to liberate the town of Villers-Bretonneux from the Germans. Our Aussies saved the town but the fighting destroyed the local school, so the children of Victoria started a campaign: 'By diggers defended, by Victorians mended.' The campaign raised 10,000 pounds sterling to rebuild the Villers-Bretonneux school which was matched by the Victorian education department. Above every blackboard in the French school, a simple phrase reminds us of the importance of the history we share: 'Never forget Australia.' It is a symbol of a promise made long before the current students were born. The loyalty between those two towns was shown again in 2009 when disaster struck in our own backyard and the school at Strathewen was burnt down by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday" rel="nofollow">
           Black Saturday
          </a>
          bushfires. To express their gratitude and to strengthen the connection between our two towns, the people of Villers-Bretonneux raised $20,000 for the Black Saturday bushfire appeal. They were deeply humbled that the Villers-Bretonneux school along with two other schools, a kindergarten and a town council pledged to help fund the rebuilding of Strathewen Primary School.
         </p>
         <p>
          The legacy of this war goes on in the hearts and minds of all those in our community. Only recently in July 2016, six formerly unknown soldiers were given headstone dedications at the Fromelles military cemetery as sign that we have never forgotten and we will never forget. We, as Australians, will never forget those who fought for our country. In this Century of Service, we pledge wholeheartedly to honour the sacrifice of all those who fought during World War I. Lest we forget.

            on 5 July 1915 and was attached to the 32nd Battalion A Company. The remains of Second Lieutenant Benson were identified in 2016 by the Australian Army's Unrecovered War Casualties Fromelles project, a team that is trying to identify 250 Australian and British World War I soldiers found in a mass grave that was discovered in 2009 at Pheasant Wood near Fromelles. Second Lieutenant Benson's name was unveiled at Fromelles at a ceremony as part of the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Fromelles.

            I sincerely hope the identification of Second Lieutenant Benson brought some peace and comfort to his family.

We should reflect on the sacrifice of Second Lieutenant Benson, who was one of 45,000 who lost their lives in World War I on the Western Front. We honour those men and their families 100 years later by finding out who they were and marking their graves. The Australian Army's Unrecovered War Casualties Fromelles project team has identified the names of 150 soldiers discovered in 2009, while 70 Australians are still unidentified.

            <i>
             Belgians have not Forgotten
            </i>
            . It was a year ago that I met with Belgian ambassador, His Excellency Jean-Luc Bodson in my office in Canberra to discuss bringing this exhibition to the bay. The ambassador had visited
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Park" rel="nofollow">
             Freedom Park
            </a>
            for the Centenary of Anzac memorial in 2014 and was impressed with the proud returned services community in the region. At the ceremony, he said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            We often have Australian visitors to our memorials and shrines, and I assure you that Belgium doesn't forget.
           </p>
           <p>
            The exhibition demonstrates that the words spoken by the ambassador still ring true today and that the strong relationship continues between the people of Belgium and the people of Australia. The exhibition features wartime artefacts, photographs, maps and film footage from the Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917 in Zonnebeke in Belgium.
           </p>
           <p>
            I encourage residents to visit the exhibition and tell family and friends about it. It is a very rare opportunity to have an exhibition of this scale in Hervey Bay, and people have already travelled from various locations to see it. I would certainly like to thank all of those involved—the Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917, the Zonnebeke council, the Flemish government, the Embassy of the Kingdom of Belgium in Australia and, lastly, the Australian government. Lest we forget.

             What these men did nothing can alter now. The good and the bad, the greatness and smallness of their story will stand … It rises, as it always will rise, above the mists of time, a monument to great-hearted men; and, for their nation, a possession for ever.

             In speaking on this motion, we remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice, those who have been identified and those unknown soldiers and we also remember the women—the mothers who were crippled with grief after losing their sons, sometimes more than one; the wives who lost their husbands and never remarried; the fiancees whose weddings were never celebrated, whose dresses were mothballed, whose hearts were broken; the fathers, the sisters, the brothers and the friends. And we remember the children—the children who had to bear the pall of grief cast over their home and family, who had to witness mothers whose lives had been shattered, fearful of their future, fearful of their security; the children who lost their fathers, or whose fathers returned from war broken, with missing limbs, or minds filled with confusion and rage and images of death, and with impossibly busy heads filled with demons. In remembering the tens of thousands who made the ultimate sacrifice, we must also remember those hundreds of thousands who came home, and have come home, wounded, be it physically or mentally. We must, as a nation, commit ourselves to providing every possible support to those who have served our country and have been injured in the process, be it mentally or physically.

             Last week, I joined with the member for Herbert in Townsville to meet with the Quine group. I had met a number of the members of the group last year when I held a roundtable on the antimalarial drug mefloquine. As with last year, the trauma of the group was palpable. Along with my colleague the shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I continue to urge the government to listen to these people, and not just listen to them but to actually hear them. I continue to urge the government to reach out to these people in a genuine and meaningful way. Last year, the government committed to address concerns about mefloquine in four ways: it committed to community consultation to provide an open dialogue between
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
              DVA
             </a>
             and Defence; it committed to a comprehensive online resource; it committed to a dedicated mefloquine support team; and it committed to an interdepartmental DVA-Defence Links Committee to discuss the issues and provide advice to the government by November 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
             From last week's discussions, it would appear the consultation has all been one way and more a process of providing information from Defence to the community rather than a genuine open dialogue. The online resource is just a one-way information source, not a resource, and the hotline, I understand, does not operate for 24 hours and some people have found it very difficult to get through. November 2016 has been and gone, and if the advice from the committee has been given to the government it has not been made public. I urge the government to reach out to the Quinn group and other groups on the mefloquine issue. By reaching out, I mean listening to them, hearing them, and learning about their pain, their suffering and their heartbreak. We must care for and support all Australians who have served our country. Lest we forget. We will remember them.

              The motion before the House today is about a date of great importance for our nation and its history. In mid-October of 1918, the Allied forces advanced and fractures showed between the

Germany felt the immense pressures of war and its power began to implode, with the Kaiser finally abdicating on 9 November. At 5 am on 11 November, the final armistice was signed, calling for an immediate cessation of fighting along the

As many as one-third of these were left with no known grave. In addition to this loss, a further 20 million were wounded. From Australia, with a population of less than five million at the time, 416,809 Australian men enlisted, of whom 60,000 were killed. Over 16,900 Australians remain unknown or unaccounted for on the Western Front. A further 156,000 Australians were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner. The

              As weapons were laid down on 11 November, the Allied nations chose this day to remember and commemorate those lost at war. It remains a significant day for all Australians, as communities across the country, from small towns to big cities, pause to remember the sacrifice of Australian servicemen and servicewomen. The period from 2014 to 2018 marks the Century of Service, a time where Australians are given a chance to remember the service and sacrifice of all who fought during

              on 19 July 1916 was the first key engagement of our Australian soldiers on the Western Front. The Australian Fifth Division suffered 5,533 casualties in the first 24 hours, making it Australia's single most bloody day in our military history. Almost 300,000 Australians served on the Western Front. Forty-five thousand Australians lost their lives, and more than one-third of those have no known grave. In July of last year, six formerly unknown Australian soldiers were given headstone dedications at the Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery. It allowed us as Australians to recognise the sacrifices they made and the hardships they endured to make this nation what it is today.

              on 4 September 1916 and left for France in the following June. Only three months later, Private Mellor was killed in action. He was shot by a sniper while delivering ammunition to the front line. Private Mellor's name can be found on the City of Belmont's War Memorial in Faulkner Park, alongside the names of 33 other soldiers from the Belmont district who also lost their lives in the Great War. In 2015 the memorial was upgraded after the City of Belmont successfully secured $50,000 from the federal government as part of the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. The funding contributed to a $280,000 upgrade project which saw the installation of ramps, additional flagpoles and panels for commemorative plaques. The Belmont War Memorial, originally erected in 1923 to commemorate those that lost their lives in the Great War, now recognises the service and the sacrifices of all our men and women who have been directly involved with all the wars and conflicts that have followed.

               fell silent after all the slaughter and the carnage. We use Remembrance Day to honour and remember the fallen and those left behind. Like you, Deputy Speaker Hastie, I am a proud former defence member. I am also the son of Vietnam veteran who lost some mates and the grandson of a World War
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

               veteran who lost some mates. In recent times I have spent a lot of time with veterans and their families.
              </p>
              <p>
               Recently in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_End" rel="nofollow">
                Top End
               </a>
               a great event was put on by the Defence Community Organisation to welcome new families to Darwin. We also commemorated the 75th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin. So, in the short space of a couple of weeks, there have been a lot of opportunities for defence families and veterans to get together and talk. What has really struck me is that we have a serious problem in our country when it comes to how our veterans are going.
              </p>
              <p>
               Do not get me wrong: the majority of our veterans are soldiering on. They are either still in the Army, Navy or
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
                Air Force
               </a>
               or they have got out of the military and are just trying to get on with life. Many are going into different workplaces and doing incredibly well because of the skills, attitudes and knowledge they have picked up during their service. I recommend soldiers, sailors and airmen to any prospective employer. There is no doubt that a percentage of those in the veterans' community are having some troubles. In my seat of Solomon and in Palmerston, I am struck at how few mental health services there are for these veterans. A lot of families and even some veterans who have been personally affected have come up to me basically asking for help.
              </p>
              <p>
               The reality is that you have to fly interstate from Darwin if you want to get some focused psychiatric care. Often that is away from your family, which is difficult for people. I think we can do better. A lot of people in our community who were in the emergency services or who are veterans are suffering from post-traumatic stress or anxiety or depression. In the Top End we probably need a program that is veteran-specific, that has focused psychiatric rehabilitation at its core, with health professionals that understand
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
                PTSD
               </a>
               . I think that is something we can work towards. I want to acknowledge the families, because obviously they often bear the brunt, not only those families who have lost someone but those families who have had someone come back to them who is not the same as they were before.

              <p>
               They are beautiful words. On Remembrance Day we honour the dead and we remember the living. Lest we forget.

                I rise to associate myself with the comments of the previous speakers on this motion about
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
                 Remembrance Day
                </a>
                that is before the House at the moment. Unlike the families of other members that have made a contribution in this chamber today, my family were not participants in any great war. We do not have, around our dining table, stories of grandfathers or uncles not coming back. I feel that there are many families in Australia and in my electorate that are in the same situation. But I ask the question of the House: with all these families like mine that do not have an affinity or connection through a personal contribution, why is it that we are seeing an increase in numbers at ceremonies for Remembrance Day and Anzac Day? I suggest that the Australian public are rolling out in great numbers because there is an enormous amount of work being done by Veterans' Affairs and
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
                 RSL
                </a>
                s in our community, and that is touching a lot of families, and that Australians more generally see the benefit and know that they now sleep under a blanket of security that those fallen soldiers have made for our nation.
               </p>
               <p>
                Recently I had the pleasure of visiting Laidley, in the western part of my electorate, where we made a presentation of $34,000 to our veterans' affairs association to upgrade their kitchen and their clubhouse. These are incredible people who go about their business quietly in my community and work behind the scenes offering support to each other. Some of the stories they will tell you about the aftermath of their personal encounters, of their suffering as a result of their combat or service, are truly horrifying. I am proud that, as a community, we reach out and we put our arms around these people—and a lot of the problems that are out there are still unknown.
               </p>
               <p>
                I wanted to rise and just let the House be aware that you do not have to have strong linkages or walk up the road with a medal on you to appreciate the work that has been done by the proud ex-service men and women of our nation. In closing, I would just like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of those in my electorate who have made a contribution, because, as I mentioned earlier on, it is that contribution that you have made to our nation that provides the blanket of security that we sleep under today. Lest we forget.

                 , the suffering, the torment and indeed the dying continued right through to 1923. The casualties of the Great War were 17 million dead, of whom seven million were civilians, and 20 million wounded. Australian casualties were 60,000 killed and 156,000 wounded. They are the worst losses of any kind in our nation's history. In fact, if you add together the casualties of all the wars after that, you still do not get to those losses.

                 we stop to remember those losses and the suffering that families right across the country endured. But we should also think about the value of living in peace and how over the centuries the greed and selfish egos of individuals have too often caused so much misery to others. It still happens today. For Australia, the end of

                 Remembrance Day is also the time to acknowledge all of the Australians who have served our nation over the years. It is something we do not do well enough in this country. A week ago I attended a 75th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin service at the Salisbury RSL. The member for

                 and the member for Wakefield joined me at that service. As we know, 240 lives were lost as a result of the bombing of Darwin, and the bombings continued for some 19 months afterwards. The Darwin Defenders were formed and military personnel and civilians both took part in security operations. Jeffrey Marr was one of those defenders. He enlisted immediately after the bombing of Darwin and in the months that followed he drove a truck in convoy carting 44-gallon drums of fuel from

                 —but no recognition by the Australian government.

                <p>
                 The military awards system is failing our defence personnel, and we need to do better. There are many other cases that I could allude to and that at times I have taken up with various ministers ever since I have been in this place—on most occasions without any success whatsoever. Yet, having listened to these individual accounts of what these people did in service to this nation, it beggars belief that we do not afford them the recognition that I believe they are entitled to and that they deservedly should be granted. Perhaps this is a matter for another time.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Finally, I also want to acknowledge those people who served in the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War" rel="nofollow">
                  Korean War
                 </a>
                 . Their service is often overlooked. Over 17,000 Australians served in the Korean War—340 were killed and 1,216 were wounded. Quite often when we speak in this place, and when I go to other services, including RSL functions, it seems that the Korean War is perhaps touched on but never given the recognition that it ought to be. In fact, the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kapyong" rel="nofollow">
                  Battle of Kapyong
                 </a>
                 , which saw 32 Australians killed and 53 wounded, could be described as a heroic effort that in some ways could be compared to the

                  Battle of Long Tan
                 </a>
                 —which we do acknowledge each year, certainly in my part of Adelaide. We have done that for many years, and rightly so—but we should be doing the same thing with other battles. There are other examples I would dearly love to touch on, but today we are talking about Remembrance Day. Every community in this country that I know has borne the pain of war—that is why Remembrance Day is so important.

                  . It is very important that we remember those who have given their lives in the service of our country. In Australia we have remembrance everywhere. We have memorials, we have plaques; most small country towns have a memorial at the heart of their township which reminds us of the sacrifice that many have made.

                  cadets. I was one of those cadets at the time. We visited Passchendaele, the Somme and Villers-Bretonneux—the mayor there popped champagne for us, very generously. We got to go to the school and Moquet Farm. It was the first time it had really hit me how much blood and treasure this country committed in World War I. There were 60,000 war dead.

                  and demanded heavy reparations from Germany—only to be denied by the President of the United States. He then replied: 'I speak for 60,000 war dead. Who do you speak for?' Well he might have said those words, because it is not until you get over there that you really appreciate how significant that sacrifice was.

                  Many young men who might have become parliamentarians, who might have returned to Australia and become doctors or teachers or factory workers, fathers, husbands—all those things that we look forward to in life—were denied these at a very young age. I think of all the women, some of the nurses who perished and the many nurses who served for four years treating our wounded. They are often overlooked, so it was greatly satisfying a couple of weeks ago to remember the nurses of

                  who gave their lives 75 years ago. They were massacred—21 of them—by Japanese soldiers in a brutal war crime.

                  At home in Canning we have remembrance all throughout my electorate. The township of Byford has a wonderful war memorial, and I was part of the ceremony there on Anzac Day last year. There is Pinjarra in central Canning. At Mandurah we have a beautiful war memorial overlooking the water. And then there are little towns like Coolup with only a couple of hundred people. Coolup is a town that has given much in the service of this country.
