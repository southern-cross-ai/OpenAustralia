        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister promised before the election, 'We will help families with the real cost of raising children,' but the Prime Minister's budget will cost families as much as $5,000 a year as a result of his cuts to family payments, plus his new

        </a>
        tax plus his increase to petrol taxes. Why should Australian families pay up to $5,000 per year for the Prime Minister's deceit?

         This budget enshrines two great Australian values: the fair go that we preserve and the 'have a go' value that we want to encourage. They are the values that are embodied in this budget.

           I know that some benefits for families are changing and I accept that. I make the point that it is important to maximise participation in the workforce and it is important to bear down on what is sometimes described as middle-class welfare. It is important to do that, but it is important to do that in ways that are fair.
          </p>
          <p>
           If the people of Australia want to look at the budget documentation, they will see, for instance, that if you are a single-income family, with one child under six, with $30,000 of income you are still receiving more than $18,000 from the taxpayer. If you are a single-income family, with one child, on $90,000 you are still receiving $6,000 from the taxpayer.
          </p>
          <p>
           I say again, if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is very anxious to ensure that this government keeps its commitments and if she is as anxious as she says she is to ease the squeeze on families then let us repeal the carbon tax straightaway. Let us repeal the carbon tax straightaway and give all the families of Australia a $550 windfall. Let us give them $550 a year straightaway.

               He was over the moon, absolutely over the moon, as many other researchers are about the government's commitment to medical research. Not only are we providing record amounts now to medical research, but we will increase that investment as we go forward. As a nation, we face a great threat as our population ages in relation to dementia and diseases of the brain otherwise. In fact, it is projected that by 2050, 7,500 Australians each week will present with dementia. We have to make the investment today to make sure that we can provide the opportunities for research and discovery that will assist our doctors and our scientists to make those discoveries and to implement the medications and the advice that flow from them. I am very proud of the fact that we are in this portfolio at this time able to say that we will increase health expenditure over the forward estimates in 2014-15 by 3.7 per cent. In 2015-16 it increases again to $68.2 billion. It increases in 2016-17, it increases in 2017-18, and health funding will continue to grow in this budget.

              <p>
               We will set this health system up for the future, not just for today. We will protect it against the Labor Party into the future. This fund will have its capital protected, because it will be guarded by the Future Fund guardians. We will not allow Labor to attack the $20 billion. We will make sure that the $1 billion a year that will flow from this $20 billion capital fund will supplement the money that we are putting into medical research now—which will grow to about $2 billion a year—and we will stop the Labor Party from spending that $20 billion at any time in the future. This fund is about setting the future up for this country and that is what this government is about.

                 We made a commitment that every dollar of saving is reinvested in the world's largest medical research fund, which will be good for cures, treatment, and the health of all Australians in the years and decades ahead.

                 The shadow minister says that somehow I am unfit for office because I support a co-payment. There is a better way of operating a health system, and the change could hardly hurt at all. As economists have shown, the ideal model involves a small co-payment—not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doctor—and the idea is hardly radical. Who said that? The shadow assistant treasurer.

                 am not fit for office, neither is he, presumably, and I imagine that the Leader of the Opposition will be requiring his resignation.

                  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If what the member for Canberra said 15 years ago is relevant, what the Prime Minister said six months ago—

                   The member will resume his seat. That is an abuse of the standing orders, and the member knows it. Another infringement and you are to leave us. The Prime Minister has concluded his answer.
