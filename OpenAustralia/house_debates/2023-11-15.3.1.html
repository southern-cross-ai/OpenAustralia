       <p class="italic">
        (1) acknowledges:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) Australia's 370,000 first responders are the brave individuals on the frontline tackling compounding and cascading disasters, risking their lives to safeguard communities and property;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the work of first responders is a service to our nation and we honour it, and that some experiences can be distressing, traumatic and dangerous;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) it is crucial to provide ongoing, comprehensive national support and enhance the resilience and capability of first responders, especially during and immediately after the current severe bushfire season; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) Fortem Australia is the leading provider of this support for first responders nationwide, providing effective care to 15,000 unique first responders and their families across the nation, including 37,000 wellbeing activity registrations and delivery of over 6,100 clinical psychology sessions;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) notes the Government's delay in confirming additional continued funding for this important work to continue beyond March 2024, resulting in significant uncertainty and a risk that Fortem Australia will need to begin to scale down its operations from November 2023; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) urgently calls upon the Government to announce continued funding for Fortem Australia prior to the commencement of the upcoming summer bushfire period, ensuring that first responders know where to tum in their time of need, and ensuring the seamless delivery of nation-leading support to these dedicated individuals.

        (a) increasing importance of research in the field of genetics in advancing our understanding of better treatments and healthcare policy for the betterment of patients; and

       <p class="italic">
        (b) opportunities provided by genetic research and that the findings from life-changing treatments should be regarded as ways and means to provide targeted treatments for patients suffering from disorders such as epilepsy, auto-immune diseases, cancers, heart disease and many others;

       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        (b) the are imperative in protecting the field of genetics from exploitation and limiting the risk of patient records and disorders being used in discriminatory manners by third parties, such as the life insurance industry, whose current ability to use genetic test results in assessing applications and claims has led to great frustration and should be stopped; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) this concern with privacy must not damage research in the genetics field and the benefits that advances in treatments provide, however, it is in the interest of this field that individuals are not discouraged from sharing information of their disorders; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on Commonwealth, state and territory governments to work towards legislation that will restrict third party access to genetic information and ensure that the only party able to choose when and how to disclose genetic information is the individual themselves.
