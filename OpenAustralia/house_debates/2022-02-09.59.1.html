        My question is to the Prime Minister. A year ago the Prime Minister told the House he'd asked his former chief of staff to investigate what his office knew and when about the reported assault of Ms Higgins, just metres from his office. How is it possible that he still doesn't know who in his office knew what and when?

        <p>
         Just before I call the Prime Minister, I do want to make a statement about this, and I'd ask all members for their very careful attention. Members know that sometimes during proceedings they might refer to specific or more general legal matters. From time to time, Speakers find it necessary to remind members about the powerful privilege of freedom of speech which attaches to those contributions. With this privilege comes the responsibility for us all to choose our words very carefully, with due regard to potential consequences. This is especially so in relation to remarks about a specific criminal matter where charges have been laid. The sub judice convention of the House is one guide to us in exercising the free speech privilege responsibly.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'd like to take this opportunity to remind members that, while the House has an inherent right to inquire into and debate matters of public importance, at the same time the Speaker has discretion to ensure that the House does not set itself up as an alternative forum to the courts or that proceedings of the House do not interfere with the course of justice. It's natural that members might take a special interest in a criminal matter which relates to the parliament or the parliamentary precincts. Nevertheless, such an aspect does not relieve us of our responsibilities. I therefore remind all members to exercise the rights they have as members responsibly in order not to risk prejudicing any court proceedings.

               Because of previous questions, I can understand the Prime Minister might have thought this was something different, but in terms of direct relevance this is not a question about the Gaetjens report. This is a question about whether or not it's possible that the Prime Minister still does not himself know the answer to this.
