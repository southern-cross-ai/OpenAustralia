           I join other members this morning in acknowledging that the Order of Australia is the highest national honour awarded to Australian citizens for their astounding contribution to our nation. Of course, there is a military division in the Order of Australia as well. Since the order was established by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
            Her Majesty
           </a>
           the late Queen Elizabeth II in 1975, there have been 40,000 recipients of awards in the Order of Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am proud to be a member of the Order, receiving the Order of Australia medal on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
            Australia Day
           </a>
           2006 for volunteer work for Timor-Leste. It was very humbling, and I continue to work for our nation in a variety of roles to honour membership of the Order and to serve Australians.
          </p>
          <p>
           Today we celebrate the 1,047 Australia Day 2023 award recipients. I congratulate all of those recipients, and I'd particularly like to acknowledge all Australians who were nominated and awarded. One of those recipients is
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timmy_Duggan" rel="nofollow">
            Timmy Duggan
           </a>

           ,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBL" rel="nofollow">
            NBL
           </a>
           , player from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">
            NT
           </a>
           . He has used his passion for sports to build resilience in our young kids, including at our youth detention centre in Darwin, the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre. In fact, it was Timmy who first invited me to join him to go into Don Dale to spend time with young Territory kids, and he has done powerful work to help them get on the right track.
          </p>
          <p>
           Take the remarkable story of Maureen Langdon, who was recognised for her services to nursing. Maureen was the first full-time female ambulance officer in Australia. She worked in the Territory for 48 years, including for the Northern Territory St John Ambulance service.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also want to congratulate my friend
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gray" rel="nofollow">
            Henry Gray
           </a>
           for his services to education, which included teaching in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groote_Eylandt" rel="nofollow">
            Groote Eylandt
           </a>
           , Nhulunbuy and Darwin. Henry said to me that he gave up a possible inheritance of a family farm to enter teachers college, and he was a mature age student in 1968. He found educating young Australians and young Territorians to be such a fulfilling career. Let me say to you, Henry, that you acquitted your responsibilities with integrity. You made such a difference to those that you educated, and you kept a smile on your heart. Well done, mate.
          </p>
          <p>
           I acknowledge Berverley McCormack for her services to remote nursing in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Central Australia
           </a>
           , since 2006, as well as Dr Sadhana Mahajani who helped establish Darwin's first community health centre, in 1974, and kept on working out of a demountable after
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Tracy" rel="nofollow">
            Cyclone Tracy
           </a>
           ripped through our city. I heard her interviewed on radio recently. It was a truly inspiring story. Another Territorian to receive the Order of Australia is Superintendent Peter Malley, who worked in NT Police, including in Darwin, and currently in Palmerston, for 20 years. Pete has also been recognised for his service with an
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Police_Medal" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Police Medal
           </a>
           . Well done.
          </p>
          <p>
           Finally, I want to pay tribute to Sue McCallum for her amazing service to veterans over decades. Sue was posted, in Darwin, as a radio operator in the Navy. She comes from a family of veterans, across the generations, and she's been spending her time, over the last decades, helping veterans to navigate the compensation system with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
            Department of Veterans' Affairs
           </a>
           . She has been volunteering for Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia NT, Veterans Australia NT and Mates4mates. Sue said she was overwhelmed to receive an Order of Australia. She felt like she had not done so much, and that's so true of many humble people receiving these awards. But, as a long-term member of Veterans Australia NT, I know how much you have done, Sue. Well done. It's truly important and selfless work.
          </p>
          <p>
           I welcome the valuable work of the NT committee for the order and encourage people to nominate exceptional Australians.

             Thank you, Deputy Speaker Payne, and I offer my hearty congratulations on your appointment as well. I rise today to support the motion, by the member for Page, which highlights the great work of those people who have received awards this
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
              Australia Day
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Australia Day is a day we come together to celebrate our great nation and all that it has to offer, whether it's going to the beach to play cricket or gathering with family and friends for a barbie. It's also a day that highlights the great work given from people from our communities and awards them with recognition. Around our nation, many community champions received Australia Day awards. In my electorate of Dawson, there are more than 40 I would like to acknowledge in this place. I would like to take the opportunity to give a shout-out to these amazing people who put so much of themselves and their time into our communities. I think it only appropriate to see them recognised for their efforts. As it is in most areas, these awards range from volunteer acknowledgements, environmental awards, sporting achievers, citizens of the year and the prestigious Order of Australia medal. However, they all acknowledge one thing: how dedicated and selfless our people are.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Mackay, there are seven people who received awards: Sergeant Nigel Dalton, Citizen of the Year, Keira Brown, Jody Burrows, Alison Richardson, Brenda Windsor, Connor Parish, Dr Judith Wake and the Pioneer Valley Machinery Preservationists Society. These people are all heavily involved in the Mackay community, in a major way, through sporting groups, not-for-profit organisations and so much more.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the Burdekin, the recipients were Gerald Henaway, Zavier Wood, Brent Dingle, Kate Casswell, Ricky Gudge,

             , Beth Wall, Keith Kiloh, Aileen Jones, Eliza Worlein, Jarrod Langford, Makayla Pirrone, Kiera Wiseman, Ellyana Mugica and the committee of the Burdekin Race Club. The Burdekin is truly a better place with these ladies and gents around. The dedication and drive they have for their region is something they should all be proud of.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the Whitsundays, the awardees showcased were: Marlene Reiffel, Lisa Stanley,

             </a>
             , Mac Rogers, Anne-Marie Kehres, Kids at the Beach Childcare Centre and the Bowen Neighbourhood Centre. There are so many opportunities to get involved in the Whitsundays and these recipients truly took it upon themselves to get in amongst what the region has to offer.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Townsville, the northern part of my electorate, awardees acknowledged were: Peter Shefford, Kobe Chun-Tie, Darren Randall, Allan Jefferson, Maree McClelland, Zoe Chester and Dr Adam Smith. The Townsville region is a beautiful part of Queensland, and these seven recipients have truly made the most of their tropical city. I was lucky and honoured to be able to travel around the electorate on Australia Day to witness some of these recipients receiving their awards. A huge congratulations to all Australia Day award recipients.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'd also like to make mention of the hundreds of residents around my region who were nominated for an Australia Day Award. As we all know, there can be only a certain number of people who win the award, but all these nominees put in hours of their time, sacrificing their time and energy for the betterment of our region.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's one last person I'd like to acknowledge—Mr Ronald Bassan

             </a>

             </a>
             for his distinguished military service and the contribution to Mackay's community as a civilian. He has been loyal to our nation his entire life. He celebrated his 21st birthday in a Malaysian jungle camp while deployed. What a trooper! Mr Bassan, a local legend up my way, deserves every accolade he receives. Thank you for your service and congratulations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Throughout 2023 I'm excited to see even more community events starting up or returning after COVID, and more locals getting involved.

               I congratulate and thank all of our wonderful award winners and honours recipients and also pass on the appreciation of our region for all they do for our communities. These awards are richly deserved recognition, and we are all very proud of them and all that they have achieved.

                 Thank you, Deputy Speaker—and can I say I'm so pleased to see you sitting in the chair. I am very glad to have this opportunity to acknowledge some of the community servants in our community. These are the people who have received

                 Order of Australia awards and Citizen of the Year awards from the Frankston City Council and the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council.

                <p>
                 We had five people in my local community honoured in the Order of Australia general civilian division this year. For significant service to tertiary medical education, Emeritus Professor Paul McMenamin of
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Eliza" rel="nofollow">
                  Mount Eliza
                 </a>
                 was awarded the

                  Member of the Order of Australia

                 since 2020, and his service to tertiary medical education means that he is a very worthy recipient of this honour. For distinguished service to medical research in the field of haematology, to tertiary education and to the promotion of science, Professor Michael Berndt of Mount Eliza has been awarded the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                  Officer of the Order of Australia
                 </a>
                 . He has been a John Curtin Distinguished Emeritus Professor since 2018. We in our community know, as do people across Australia—more so perhaps than anyone realised before 2020—how important it is to have people like Professor McMenamin and Professor Berndt, who promote science, who serve tertiary education to educate our future scientists and who work in areas where medicine and medical research save lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For service to the community through a range of organisations, Mrs Jean Gilbert of Mount Eliza was awarded the

                 the Less Anglican Church in Mount Eliza, the Peninsula Home Hospice Women of Action biennial luncheon and many more. She is such a stalwart of the community. For service to veterans, Mr Kevin Hunter of Frankston was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia. He has been on the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia's Victorian branch as a state welfare director for 25 ongoing years. As a patron of the Frankston branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, I thank him and everyone else for the work that they do. He has made many veteran welfare contributions and served in the Army and

                </p>
                <p>
                 For service to the community, particularly through the church, Mr Ricky Painter of Langwarrin received a Medal of the Order of Australia. He is a senior pastor at Gateway Church Australia and a co-producer of the Good Friday Family Festival, a terrific festival that occurs on the Frankston foreshore. I'm very proud of our two police officers who received a meritorious award: Commander Martin O'Bryan, for 42 years with the

                 The 2023 citizens of the year awards in Frankston were a terrific event.

                 of the Year was Warwick Exton, who is an amazing 100-year-old, cheeky man, who I have spoken about in the chamber before. His contributions to the community are outstanding, and his book,
                 <i>
                  Action Sweetwater Creek
                 </i>
                 , is a great historical record of some very important environmental work in our community. Young Citizen of the Year,
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Lyons" rel="nofollow">
                  Jack Lyons
                 </a>
                 , is right now incredibly tired because he has almost finished running 50 marathons in 50 days to raise money for those experiencing homelessness. It's a feat that I think is actually unimaginable, and he is amazing for having done it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Community Group of the Year, that I am an ambassador for, was the Women's Spirit Project, which grew out of a grassroots community initiative established by women for women within Frankston. Jodie Belyea is a woman who is incomparable; she has such a drive and passion to serve our community and to help women who are vulnerable or in need. It is so well-deserved for everyone who was part of the Women's Spirit Project.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Mornington Peninsula Shire Council's Young Citizen of the Year was Josh Berry from Mount Eliza, who is collecting 50,000 pairs of socks so that every one of the 23,000 homeless people in Victoria can have two pair each. What a contribution and dedication to the community! Congratulations, everyone.
