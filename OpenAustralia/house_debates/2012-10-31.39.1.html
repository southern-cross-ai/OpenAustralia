        While much has been said in this place about the significance of Australia's temporary seat on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        Security Council, let me assure the House that that is not the only place where Australia will have an increased voice. I rise today to congratulate a very special constituent of mine, Joe Aarons. Joe has recently been appointed the President of World Bowls. Joe is currently the President of Bowls Australia but will relinquish his role to take up his new position in December this year during the world championships to be held in Adelaide. I am fortunate enough to consider Joe a good friend of mine. It was Joe who convinced me to join the board of Bowls Australia, and I was happily a director there for two years. My time working with Joe could not have been more pleasant and enjoyable. A true professional, Joe was always a pleasure to work with. I can say with full confidence that World Bowls is in good hands with Joe in charge. I wish him all the best for his tenure. He brings with him great experience and great knowledge.

        In Australia the sport with the highest participation is in fact bowls. More than 800,000 people participate in bowls each and every year. It is a shame, though, that bowls has been taken off the ABC. We were able to table in this place last year the third-largest petition to try and bring back bowls to the ABC—something that has been televised for more than 30 years. We hope that, with the increased support of those opposite, this may indeed be achieved.
