            I thank the member for his question. I was talking to some of the journos this morning. I note Clare Armstrong has made the effort to come here. She is the only one. Good on you, Clare. We were talking about question time today. But this is not something I anticipated. It might be news to the member for Bradfield that every major business in Australia is supporting the 'yes' campaign. Woolworths, Coles, Telstra,

            s were that day; they were the Indigenous workers, who I was proud to meet. Going back more than a decade—because the point is here that this referendum has been a long time coming; planes were painted with the 'R' for 'recognise' more than a decade ago, just as planes were painted, like the
            <i>

            , to pay respect to

            a long time ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Companies are doing this because they understand. They've introduced reconciliation action plans. They have done so much. So many companies are doing good things, employing Indigenous Australians—particularly in regional Australia, it must be said. And that's a good thing. So it should be no surprise whatsoever that, along with a range of other businesses, they are all supporting the 'yes' campaign. Indeed, the Business Council of Australia—Tim Reed, the president, was talking to me at the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCA" rel="nofollow">
             BCA
            </a>
            dinner just a couple of weeks ago about the enormous support, and how there is such support across the business community for 'yes' because they also know it's important for their businesses.
