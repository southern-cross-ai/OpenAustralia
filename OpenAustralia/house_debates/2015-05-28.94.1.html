        My question is to the Minister for the Environment. I refer the minister to an article in the
        <i>
         Townsville
        </i>
        <i>
         Bulletin
        </i>
        on Tuesday stating that ratepayers in Townsville will receive a $35 refund due to the repeal of the carbon tax. Will the minister update the House on how much families and businesses are saving following the removal of the carbon tax and are there any threats to this approach?

         I particularly want to thank the member for Herbert for his second question on the environment in two days. Incidentally, that is as many questions as the entire Labor Party have mustered between them in almost two years. The member for Herbert is not just a great champion of the environment. Yesterday as I was completing my answer, and I spoke to him just a little bit afterwards, I could detect just a hint of hurt in his eyes that I had not used the same terms to describe him as I had for the member for Pearce—good looking, charming and intelligent. I just want to affirm to the House that all those terms apply, as well as many other encomiums. The member for Herbert is not just all of those things. He is a great fighter for the reef and for the families of Herbert. He voted to abolish the carbon tax and to deliver a $550 a year benefit for the households of Herbert. That meant a $35 refund, a $35 benefit, for local ratepayers in the city of Townsville.
        </p>
        <p>
         A government member: Electricity bills.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yes, a reduction of up to 9.4 per cent in electricity bills for Queensland families. But that is going to change, isn't it? What we took away, you are about to give back. We reduced electricity prices. We reduced gas prices. For a fishing vessel in Townsville, there was a $16,000 reduction in the cost of re-gassing as they go out to fill up. That is what we saw when we took away the carbon tax. The member for Herbert asked about threats to those savings, and there are some threats. This is the year of Labor's big ideas. That is going swimmingly well, isn't it?
        </p>
        <p>
         A government member: It is a festival!
        </p>
        <p>
         Yes, a festival of big ideas. It might perhaps be better described as a year of old ideas. We heard something from the member for McMahon, just a week ago, at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
          Press Club
         </a>
         . What are they going to do? They are going to bring back the carbon tax. But what we read in the papers today is that they are not just going to bring back the carbon tax, they are going to bring back the architect.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Combet" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         is back to redraft the carbon tax. So what are we going to see? A $550 increase for families. There will be increased electricity prices for families, increased electricity prices for small businesses and increased electricity prices for pensioners. So it is not just the carbon tax that is back. The architect is back. The bills are back. Electricity prices are going up. In the year of old ideas, this is a bad one that you should reject.

          My question is to the minister representing the Attorney-General. I refer to the letter the Attorney-General received from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Haron_Monis" rel="nofollow">
           Man Haron Monis
          </a>
          on 9 October, two months before the Sydney siege. Does the minister agree with the Attorney-General that a letter from a convicted felon known to security agencies and on bail for violent criminal offences requesting advice about contacting the head of what the Prime Minister describes as the 'death cult', received within a month of the threat level being raised to its highest level in Australia's history, can be classified as 'routine correspondence'?

           I notice the member for Isaacs is concerned with the use of a particular title in this letter. It is evident that titles can be quite misleading—the member for Isaacs is referred to as '
