            Pacific island countries are facing many challenges, so inevitably we are generous. Australia now provides nearly $1 billion a year in effective aid to the

             South Pacific

            , if you include

             Papua New Guinea
            </a>
            . One of the keys to our policy is good governance, which in our view is a cornerstone of sustainable development. The quality of government underpins economic prosperity, quality of life and also security.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our aid program has included restoration of the rule of law and justice in the

            The honourable member asked if there were any alternatives. There are. The member for Maribyrnong, as the shadow minister for overseas aid and Pacific island affairs, has worked tirelessly on this issue. I remember warmly the time he travelled with me in December 2004 to the Pacific islands.

              He showed interest, enthusiasm and decency. I was very impressed with him and got on very well with him, if I may say so, to interject a personal element here. He produced very recently a policy which, let us face it, had a few less than flattering things to say about the government, but I suppose that is the work of an opposition. But he put a lot of work into it, and whether you agree with all of it or not you have to admire a man who went to that much trouble. The Leader of the Opposition said yesterday of the member for Maribyrnong that he was an outstanding shadow minister who had developed an encyclopaedic knowledge of the affairs of the region. I think that is right, which makes me wonder why the Leader of the Opposition did not support him—

                 As I was saying, such a good and successful shadow minister, a member of this House with such experience, deserves the support of his leader. And he did not get it, despite the fact that his leader thought he was outstanding. Either he said he was outstanding but did not mean it, which is why he did not support him, or he did not think he was outstanding at all but thought he may as well say it. It is either one or the other. Those are certainly not the words of a strong man and a true leader.

                <p>
                 So, as his colleagues are taken away one by one to political execution, the Leader of the Opposition washes his hands like

                 and just allows them to be taken away. ‘It’s nothing to do with me, Officer,’ I suppose is his message.

                  Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the minister commenced his remarks with generous comments about his opposition counterpart but plainly now is entering into irrelevancy with a denigration of the Leader of the Opposition. It is not in his portfolio area. It is a tactic and it should be resisted by the chair.

                    Let me in conclusion go back to what I was saying about alternative policies. The Leader of the Opposition is prepared to dismiss the member for Maribyrnong—he was not prepared to support him—yet the member for Maribyrnong put more effort into policy in his short period as shadow minister than the Leader of the Opposition has put into policy in his endless years as Leader of the Opposition.
