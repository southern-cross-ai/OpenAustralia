       <p>
        I rise today to pay tribute to the 100th anniversary of women in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Police Force. The anniversary marks a significant milestone for the force, which is celebrating the evolution of the role of women in policing in New South Wales since the introduction of our first female special constables in 1915. One hundred years ago, in 1915, the New South Wales Police Department placed advertisements for two female officers. Nearly 500 women applied for the positions. Two applicants, Lillian Armfield and Maude Rhodes, were chosen and became the first female officers in Australia. Lillian and Maude were required to sign an indemnity releasing the police department of any responsibility for their safety. They were also required to wear civilian clothes as they were not issued with a uniform. Their duties consisted of keeping young children off the streets and preventing truancy; attending to women, girls and children in the community who were particularly at risk; keeping an eye on the brothels; protecting women and girls in public parks and when leaving work in the evening; and assisting and enforcing pedestrian traffic. More crucially, however, Australia's first ever policewomen were not appointed as regular police officers but as special constables, which meant that they were not entitled to superannuation or pensions. In fact, up until 1965 female police bore all the responsibility for their financial future after retirement.

        , for instance, retired after 33 years service in 1949, having reached the rank of Special Sergeant,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Class" rel="nofollow">
         First Class
        </a>
        , and was awarded the King's Police and Fire Service Medal for distinguished service—the first woman in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire" rel="nofollow">
         British Empire
        </a>
        to receive this distinction. Yet upon retirement she received no remuneration and was forced to live on her savings until the state government later granted her a special allowance.
       </p>
       <p>
        It took half a century from when Lillian and Maude joined the force in 1915 for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Police Force
        </a>
        to cease to employ women police as special constables and for them to gain full status as officers in that force, thereby entitling them to superannuation and pension benefits. I am glad to say that in 2015 the culture and conditions for women in the New South Wales Police Force are completely unrecognisable from what they were 100 years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the last 50 years in particular, there have been dramatic changes in the workplace to encourage more women to join the police force and to ensure the removal of inhibitors for women to work and be successful in all aspects of policing. If a person has the necessary determination and aptitude then there is no reason why they cannot work in any section of the New South Wales Police Force, irrespective of whether they are male or female.
       </p>
       <p>
        At present the New South Wales Police Force has roughly 20,000 police officers, of which 35 per cent are female and 65 per cent are male. The proportion of women in the New South Wales Police Force is higher than most other law enforcement or emergency services agencies; it is higher than the proportion of women in the Army, which is 15 per cent, and higher than the proportion of women in the New South Wales Fire and Rescue workforce, which is less than five per cent. The New South Wales Police Force also has a number of high ranking female officers, including Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APM" rel="nofollow">
         APM
        </a>
        , and Assistant Commissioner Carlene York, as well as 15 female superintendents and 112 inspectors.
       </p>
       <p>
        To commemorate the remarkable contribution of women in policing over the last century, there have been a number of events, which kicked off with an expo at Tumbalong Park in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Darling Harbour
        </a>
        on 1 March showcasing to the public this history, present day policing technologies, and the forces' operational capacity. On 8 March the inaugural the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Women" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Women
        </a>
        in Policing Baton Relay was launched on the steps of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Opera_House" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Opera House
        </a>
        , and it is presently touring the state, stopping off at all of the 76 local area commands, where a variety of community events have been organised.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week was Camden's turn to receive the baton. Although, unfortunately, I was unable to attend, due to parliament sitting, I am delighted to inform the House that the event was a remarkable success and enjoyed by all. The day started at 9.45 am at the old Camden police station on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Street" rel="nofollow">
         John Street
        </a>
        in Camden, with Superintendent Doreen Cruickshank, the state's longest serving New South Wales police officer, making the opening address. Mayor of Camden Lara Symkowiak welcomed the baton to Camden, wishing it a safe passage, and Deputy Commissioner Nick Kaldas formally handed the baton to the first runners. Shortly afterwards the baton relay commenced, with a group of retired police women who had worked or lived in the Camden area carrying the baton down
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyle_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Argyle Street
        </a>
        to Cowpasture Reserve. This group included Paula Daley, the first woman stationed at both Camden and Picton; Helen Kirton, who, incidentally, enlisted at the same time as Superintendent Cruickshank; Wendy Walsh; Renee Galiantis; Pauline Goonan; Esta McKay; Evy Messa and Virginia Mackie. I would like to say a special thanks to these ladies for taking the time to stop outside my office and take a photo, which I greatly appreciated receiving last week. I just wish I could have been there to join in the celebrations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The baton relay was supported by ladies in historical uniforms from the seventies and eighties, which added to the excitement and colour of the occasion. The theme for the celebrations was 'Compassion, courage and strength'. The baton was escorted to Narellan Police Station where it was handed over to the commander of the Camden
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Superintendent Ward Hanson, his wife, Felicity, and current officers Maree Hamilton and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Young" rel="nofollow">
         Megan Young
        </a>
        , who in turn handed it to Kerrie Wright, Lauren Rice and Cath Culbert, followed by Crime Prevention Officer Greg Louden and his wife, and the police dog handler, Sandra, as the baton relay followed its journey through Narellan town centre and on to Elyard Reserve, where a presentation was held.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to thank Detective Inspector Jayne Doherty and all the staff at Camden LAC and Narellan LAC for the hard work you put in to make this event such a success. I would also like to congratulate and thank all the friends, families and members of the public who took part and showed their support for Macarthur's female police officers past and present—in particular, Paula, Helen, Wendy, Renee, Pauline, Esta and Virginia. The day was yours and I am delighted that you were able to be part of this historic occasion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, it is fantastic to see all the LACs across the states supporting the baton relay and acknowledging the wonderful contribution of our wonderful female officers. As a former New South Wales police officer I stand here proudly acknowledging the outstanding and invaluable contribution that women have provided to policing over the past 100 years and will continue to provide into the future.
