        I rise to speak about schools in the Hasluck electorate. As members we often have the privilege of interacting with schools within our electorates and on 15 November, a Tuesday, I had the privilege of visiting four schools in my electorate with the state Minister for Education, Minister Constable.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first school we went to was Gosnells Primary School. There we were met by the principal, Sue Waterhouse, and we had the opportunity of meeting with staff within the classrooms and looking at the work that they were doing with children whose learning challenges were being met by the enthusiasm of teachers. Then we had an assembly, and I was eventually dragged up to dance. It was afterwards that I felt in my joints the after-effects of doing an Aboriginal dance, but it was a great interaction. The next school was Yule Brook College in Mannington, a school that had a tremendous reputation and whose numbers then dwindled. The school took a different approach and it has become a member of the board of independent public schools. The staff are looking at the way in which they engage their students, provide for them and make learning meaningful. In that context, there was a tremendous attitude and a framework of positivity. I found the same at Clayton View Primary School with Frank Scarfone and his staff. Then we went to Darling Range Sports College, which in the afternoon opened a new stadium that was an election commitment by the coalition during the 2008 state election. The local candidate at the time, Nathan Morton, negotiated with the premier for that stadium because he recognised the tremendous opportunity it provided the sporting college to give these young people high-quality facilities that would enhance their abilities within the sporting arena.
       </p>
       <p>
        But what I want to finish on is the spirit of the teachers in each of those four schools—their absolute enthusiasm to ensure that children within their care and under their teaching were achieving destiny pathways, which kids were talking about. I had the opportunity of talking with children in the classrooms, and the enthusiasm that came from the kids was great. What I also saw was evidence from numerous teachers who think outside the square and who want to provide a learning environment that is rich and engaging. When I went to Clayton View Primary School, the last one I visited, the enthusiasm of the students about having the Minister for Education there, and the dialogue they had, was incredible. When I spoke with the teachers during the lunch break I had the opportunity of interacting with a group of people who were totally committed and caring. I acknowledge all of those four schools.
