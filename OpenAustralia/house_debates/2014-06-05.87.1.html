        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture. Following your visit to Charleville and extreme drought areas of my electorate last Friday, will you as minister inform the House how this government is supporting drought affected farmers against the backdrop of Labor's waste and mismanagement?

           I lived in the seat of Maranoa.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
            If I
           </a>
           was you guys I would just listen. You have an absolute shocker of a day: two questions ruled out of order, another two questions given to you out of charity. On a very serious issue. We have to make sure that we look after people and carry them along. To the member for Maranoa, we have had two tranches of drought policy. The first was in December last year, where we managed to get the farm finance package signed off, because the previous government had not managed to complete it, and then reallocate that money in such a form that it was more associated with drought. We also put $10 million towards water reticulation. As you are well aware, more watering points give a greater coverage for the pasture.
          </p>
          <p>
           Earlier this year, we took through a $320 million package through cabinet to look after those people in the crisis of drought. Within that is included $10 million for pest eradication. I know you are very aware of the wild dog population. And I am sure there are many people on the other side aware of the wild dog population as well!
          </p>
          <p>
           As well, there is a policy for mental health. We also dealt with issues to make sure that people have capacity to get affordable money. I am happy that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA" rel="nofollow">
            ABA
           </a>
           have come out today and said that they are trying to match our rates. It is bringing in competition and that is also good. So we are starting to get effects away from the policy. With this, we have signed off everything. I would like to thank the Treasurer and the finance minister for the work that they have done in making sure that the package does not go back down to lines on a map. That is incredibly important and I am sure you are aware of that.
          </p>
          <p>
           Away from that, I am sure the member for Maranoa is aware of the work that we are doing, especially in the sheep field. I know that sheep are so important in the western districts of the Maranoa. He would be aware that since we have opened the Bahrain trade, the price of sheep have gone up by $30 a head in the yards, which is a great return.

                Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, but I would like to address the interjection because on this side we do actually understand the policy—and he should listen, this is called 'policy'. The tranches of money that we have made available out of the $420 million for
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                 New South Wales
                </a>
                and Queensland are fully drawn. We have moved them all, because that is what we are—we are effective. The Labor Party could not even get them signed off with the states. They could not even finish the deal. We have also opened up the Egyptian trade. We now have the health protocols through for the Iranian trade. We are in negotiations with the Saudi trade. Compared to that side, we have a 19.3 per cent increase on their record for the first quarter with $10½ billion worth of agricultural products moved in the March quarter.
