         I thank the member for Fadden for his question. It gives me an opportunity to deal with this matter at question time rather than by way of personal explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me say, Mr Speaker, that when I saw the article by Major General Cantwell I was surprised, I was disappointed and I was saddened by his contribution. I did not believe that it was either an accurate or fair depiction of either that trip or of my commitment to Australian forces in the field. So I repeat: I was disappointed, surprised and saddened by that contribution.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have made four trips to Afghanistan. These things have never been said in any other context other than the contribution by Major General Cantwell over the weekend. I reject absolutely any criticism or questioning of my commitment to our forces in the field.

         There is no evidence to the contrary.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are words and there are actions. The ultimate test of a commitment to our forces in the field is what a minister and what a government do so far as providing the kit and resources required to carry out the job. In Afghanistan our forces have not been left wanting by me or the government so far as resources and kit is concerned, whether it has been upgraded Bushmasters or more Bushmasters; whether it has been better and more powerful rifles; whether it has been the work that we do in anti-

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister was simply asked to confirm or not confirm the accuracy of the story. Clearly, he is not doing that, and you should ask him to return to the substance of the question.

I make no apology for making very strongly the point in principle that it is wrong to bring into play the conduct of the innocent victim of an alleged sexual assault.
