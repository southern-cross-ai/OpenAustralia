        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to a letter from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Premier Barry O'Farrell raising concerns that the imposition of a carbon tax will destroy $5 billion in the value of New South Wales power generation assets and cause the loss of 13,000 jobs and $1.2 billion in economic activity in the Hunter region. How will the government compensate the people of the Hunter when they lose their jobs and all of New South Wales when power supplies are placed at risk? To show that there can be no misrepresentation I seek leave to table the letter from Premier Barry O'Farrell.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave not granted.

             <p>
              Number one: on the question of energy generation and the impact of carbon pricing, let me refer him to a report released last month by the Minister for Resources and Energy. It is a report by Deloittes and I think he would find it interesting reading. The report's modelling shows that delaying the introduction of a carbon price will cost Australian electricity users between $1 billion and $2 billion annually, rising to as much as $5 billion a year by 2025. That report is telling you that uncertainty about carbon pricing is causing difficulties with investment in energy generation, and we need to end that uncertainty. As the member knows, being a member in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
               New South Wales

               <p>
                They have seen increases in electricity prices and that of course is not about a carbon price. There is no carbon price in operation now, so he cannot possibly be saying to his constituents that the current increases in their electricity bills relate to that. As he well knows, the current increases in their electricity bills relate to underinvestment in distribution networks. That underinvestment needs to be made up for. That is putting price pressure on electricity now and the last thing we should do is add to the uncertainty and add to underinvestment with all of the problems that that would spell for long-term power pricing, as outlined by Deloittes.
               </p>
               <p>
                Let me go to the member for Paterson's claim about 13,000 job losses and let us try looking at the truth about that. He is referring to a study by Frontier Economics, which is from a few years ago and relates to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
                 Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
                </a>
                . What he should perhaps tell his constituents is that the Frontier modelling is showing that employment would still grow in the Hunter. That is the truth. More jobs in the Hunter. Then, he may want to tell his constituents the truth about the investments that this government is making in the Hunter to enable it to transition to a clean-energy future. For example, Newcastle is home to the Australian Solar Institute—a $150 million commitment as part of our clean energy initiatives. Is the member opposed to investment in solar energy and the Hunter?
