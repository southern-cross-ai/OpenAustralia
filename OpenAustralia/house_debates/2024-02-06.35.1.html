        The targeting of union representatives in the workplace undermines the relationship between workers and employers, and leads to poorer safety and industrial outcomes for all parties. Union delegates protect and uphold the rights that we all hold dear, and they shouldn't be unfairly punished for it—rights like safety, fair pay and the right to industrial action when necessary. We must protect delegates from employers who seek to obstruct their rights to organise in the workplace.

        negotiations on behalf of his workplace. During the heavy rain in January, he came across a flooded road that lacked any signage warning drivers of the danger. With the safety of the community in mind, Mick parked his bus to take a photo to share in a community group. Following this good deed his employment was immediately terminated without warning. I am deeply concerned that a worker would be sacked for caring for our community. Mick has made it clear that he simply wants his job back so he can continue his dedicated service.
