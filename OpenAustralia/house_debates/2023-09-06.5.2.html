       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government's rush towards 82 per cent renewable energy could expose Australia to unnecessary national security risks due to a dependence on imported solar panel components from China;

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) that almost 60 per cent of installed smart inverters are being supplied by Chinese manufacturers bound by China's national intelligence laws, which could require companies to be ordered by Beijing to sabotage, survey or disrupt power supplies to Australian homes, companies or Government;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) that energy security is national security, and the predominance of Chinese firms supplying inverters leaves Australia vulnerable to cyber-attacks;

        (e) that the Government has been aware of the concerns raised by the Opposition but continues to do nothing to alleviate the risks;

       <p class="italic">
        (f) that providing affordable and reliable energy that is free from foreign interference should be a first order priority of Government, and that the Government is failing on all fronts;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) that the Opposition's concerns have been reinforced by the Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) which has delivered a report revealing the threat posed by solar inverters; and

        (h) that the CRC has warned of the potential for a 'black start event', which:

        (i) refers to a scaled, targeted and simultaneous attack on the grid resulting in a power plant being rendered incapable of turning back on without reliance on a generator or battery; and

        (c) follow the CRC recommendation and ensure cyber security impact assessments be completed for all solar inverters being sold in Australia, and that mandatory cyber security ratings be introduced for solar inverters.

       </p>

        (2) notes that half of all road crashes are on local government roads, and these crashes account for 52 per cent of all casualties and 40 per cent of all road deaths;

        (6) calls on the Government to amend the Black Spot Road Safety Program guidelines to make it easier for the local Government sector to access that fund.

        2 MISINFORMATION LAWS: Resumption of debate (
        <i>

        ) on the motion of Mr Coleman—That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government is seeking to impose new misinformation laws in Australia which are deeply flawed;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) even before submissions closed on 20 August, the Government's exposure draft bill had already been the subject of an avalanche of criticism;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) some of the most vocal criticisms have come from leading lawyers who have clinically taken the Government's bill apart, piece by piece; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the Minister appears to have had few defenders of her plan;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges that, under the Government's exposure draft bill:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the definition of 'misinformation' is so broad that it could capture many statements made by Australians in the context of political debate;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) authorised content by the Government cannot be misinformation, but criticisms of the Government by ordinary Australians can be misinformation;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) nothing an academic says can be misinformation, but statements by somebody disagreeing with an academic can be misinformation;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) good faith statements made by entertainers cannot be misinformation, but good faith statements made by ordinary Australians on political matters can be misinformation;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) journalists commenting on their personal digital platforms could have their content removed as misinformation; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) if the Minister has a favoured digital platform, then that platform could be entirely removed from the application of the misinformation laws;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) condemns the Government for delivering this appalling exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting

        (a) admit that the Government's plan is deeply flawed; and
       </p>
