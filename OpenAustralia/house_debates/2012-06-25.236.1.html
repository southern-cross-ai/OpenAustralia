        I rise tonight to acknowledge and to applaud the excellent efforts of the Royal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Navy
        </a>
        as part of the international coalition in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        —a coalition that has performed excellent services around opposition to the smuggling of arms, drugs and other contraband, counter-piracy operations and maritime protection. It is a presence that we can all be proud of. It is a presence which has been in place now since 2001 as part of

        , which was on its third deployment as part of the 28th rotation of the

         Royal Australian Navy
        </a>
        fleet unit since 2001. We were certainly treated well and with great respect by Commander Rick Boulton, the commanding officerof the
        <i>
         Melbourne
        </i>
        , and all of his ship's crew. They certainly honoured us with the support they gave us so that we were able to gain a good understanding in a short period of time of the excellent work being done as part of that multinational force.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will just use a couple of examples to highlight the excellent work that has been done by the Australian Navy in recent years at that place. I will read from a release at the time of the return of HMAS
        <i>

       <p>
        In addition, HMAS
        <i>
         Stuart
        </i>
        in 2001 rescued three crew members who were being held hostage by pirates off the Horn of Africa. Some 15 Somali pirates surrendered to HMAS

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK" rel="nofollow">
         AK
        </a>
        -47 assault rifles with 16 magazines, a large quantity of small-arms ammunition and a rocket-propelled grenade launcher with grenade. The weapons were catalogued and then disposed of overboard. As you can see by these examples, the work that is being done by Australian naval forces as part of the Combined Maritime Forces is of exceptionally high quality and is making a real difference in the Middle East. We do not hear as much about what occurs in the Middle East, given what has been going on in Afghanistan.
       </p>
       <p>
        The

         Melbourne

        <i>
         's
        </i>
        motto, 'Vires acquirit eundo', we gather strength as we go, was certainly exhibited by the crew in their range of activities during our time on board. The professionalism, the skill and the training on display showed us we can be exceptionally proud of the men and women of the Australian Navy. We saw a crew of exceptional quality and a crew in line with the proud traditions of the Australian Navy over many decades. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the chief petty officers, who I spent a good deal of time with in their mess. I will allow others to speak later with respect to other aspects of the crew. By spending time with those guys, in particular, I got a real understanding of the great camaraderie and the very important role they play in ensuring that the spirit on board ship is kept up.
       </p>
       <p>
        I admit, I may never be able to dismiss from my mind the image of certain chief petty officers around Easter. I have to say they were some of the ugliest Easter bunnies I have ever seen, but there is no doubt they were not crossing the line on that occasion. With respect to crossing the line, as a ceremony, it did not happen while I was there. I did see some photos. It was all about good fun. It was all done in fine style.

        and all those involved, it was an honour and a privilege to spend some time with you fine men and women. The work that you do is acknowledged. Your family sacrifice the time you are away and that should always be remembered. Good on you. You are great Australians. We are all very proud you and you should be very proud of the great traditions you follow and the great work you do.

         I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Bruce, Mr Alan Griffin, to acknowledge the excellent work undertaken by our Australian naval forces in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         and in particular by

         <i>
          .
         </i>
         I applaud the contribution being made by our service men and women, regardless of where they are placed or which military forces they are in. In particular, the Royal
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Navy
         </a>
         is part of the international coalition in the Middle East. The HMAS
         <i>
          Melbourne
         </i>
         is a guided missile frigate, Adelaide-class, which launched on the 5 May 1989 and commissioned on 15 February 1992. The HMAS
         <i>
          Melbourne
         </i>
         is one of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian Navy
         </a>
         's four Adelaide-class guided missile frigates. The ship is a long-range escort capable of area, air defence, surface and undersea warfare, surveillance, reconnaissance and interdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Being part of the ADF program as a parliamentary member and being imbedded on the HMAS
         <i>
          Melbourne
         </i>
         was an incredible experience. On the ship I met young and older Australians who have been in the Navy for a number of years, ranging from their early stages through to the point where they are now talking about finishing their time with the Navy and spending time back on land. I really appreciated the fact that the two members in the chamber with me now served on that ship during that time. The experiences we had were tremendous—the fun and the opportunity to get an understanding of what each operational team on the ship does. I think that the enrichment of that experience gave me a really strong understanding of what our naval men and women commit to. What I also like is that HMAS
         <i>
          Melbourne
         </i>
         is known as the 'Red Demon', which the crew display on their T-shirts and their caps with great pride. We were given experience in the operational room through our relationship with the commanding officer, Richard Boulton, from whom we also learned a lot about the running of a ship. What really struck me was the absolute tidiness of the ship, the pride the crew take in their ship and the sections of the teams with the petty officers and chief petty officers and the 60 able seamen who occupy a space in the front of the ship. It is fascinating to watch the way every space on that ship is used and the pride there is about the ship.
        </p>
        <p>
         I went up on watch deck one morning at 4.30 and spent time watching the sun come up and talking with the crew. We talked about their experiences and why they were proud of the skills they had acquired. It was fascinating. One of the chief petty officers talked about the time they spend with family and how, when they come back off family leave and are back on the ship, crossing that line is always interesting—because one minute you are in a warm and caring environment of family but in the other you are with your naval family.
        </p>
        <p>
         We saw the humorous side, but I certainly saw highly skilled and highly efficient young people who would hold their own in any industry in Australia and whose knowledge and capabilities as a singular unit make that warship, the HMAS
         <i>
          Melbourne
         </i>
         , an extremely effective, capable weapon that can be used in peace time or in times of conflict. The discussions we had with the commanding officer were tremendous. The member moving this motion made the comment that the commanding officer wanted to be known as 'the dark lord' because we had had a joke about nicknames. So, on the day we left, the music for the dark lord was used to pipe us off the ship!
        </p>
        <p>
         The incredible young women and young men who dedicate themselves to their role and their tasks certainly do Australia proud and they do the Navy proud. I look forward to at some stage catching up with them again. Certainly in my office we will hang the medals and the memorabilia from that trip. I acknowledge them.

          I would like to thank the member for Bruce for moving this motion and allowing me the opportunity to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the Royal
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Navy
          </a>
          . Our Navy certainly plays an instrumental role in ensuring that international waters are safe to conduct trade and are free of arms and drug smuggling.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have also had the opportunity to witness first-hand on a number of occasions the bravery, professionalism and dedication of the men and women who play a part in Australia's Navy. In 2010 I visited the gulf region and witnessed first-hand their efforts, along with the air support of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
           RAAF
          </a>
          , in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Slipper" rel="nofollow">
           Operation Slipper
          </a>
          . Operation Slipper represents the Australian
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Defence Force
          </a>
          's major contribution to the international campaign against terrorism. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
           Royal Australian Navy
          </a>
          makes a significant contribution to the campaign to ensure the maritime security of our gulf region, fighting piracy and illegal trades and ensuring the smuggling of weapons, drugs and, sadly, people is combated.
         </p>
         <p>
          This year I also had the opportunity of visiting
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
           HMAS
          </a>
          <i>

          at Garden Island

           Western Australia
          </a>
          under the command of Captain Brett Wolski. Whilst the visit was essentially to look at submarines, due to the inclement weather and 20-foot waves, the member for Farrer and I nevertheless got the opportunity to examine in very close quarters issues affecting the naval operations as well as to speak to many of the officers on HMAS
          <i>
           Stirling
          </i>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          Coincidentally, during our stay in Western Australia, the HMAS
          <i>
           Toowoomba
          </i>
          was in port and working up for deployment to the gulf for another rotation. HMAS
          <i>
           Toowoomba
          </i>
          is one of our Anzac class frigates and it has made a huge contribution to the multinational task force responsibilities for protecting merchant vessels from pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia. During its role in escorting merchant fleets and conducting patrols in the Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor in 2009, the HMAS
          <i>
           Toowoomba
          </i>
          responded to a call from a merchant vessel, the

          Apart from witnessing the

          , as I also mentioned, we were treated to the most inclement weather, including driving rain and gale force winds. Due to the high damage to the local area, there was a state government request for assistance from naval personnel. Together, the member for Farrer and I spent the next day—as a matter of fact extending into the early hours of the morning—assisting with the clean-up, along with many sailors and officers of HMAS
          <i>
           Stirling
          </i>
          , of the local area at Merimbula. Apart from the work, this experience gave us the opportunity to see firsthand the Navy's relationship with the immediate community and a level of appreciation for the reliance that we have, as a community, on the men and women who make up our armed forces.
         </p>
         <p>
          I particularly commend the efforts of our escort officer, Lieutenant Owen Bowey, who ensured that we were well received at every level of this operational base. I certainly came away with a genuine sense of pride in the men and women who are prepared to wear the Navy uniform, to accept the discipline and, above all, to put the nation before themselves. The professionalism and the dedication of the men and women of our Navy was particularly evident over the past couple of days, particularly in the search and rescue mission that has recently taken place off the coast of Western Australia in respect of asylum seekers. The Royal Australian Navy, together with the border protection command and the

          and their merchant ships, have been instrumental in saving the lives of more than 110 people at this point.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Navy's job is certainly a difficult one. We are forever in their debt for their bravery, their selflessness and their dedication. Australia is right to be proud of all those who serve in our Navy.

           departed Australian shores to complete her third tour of duty. Two hundred and thirty-six men and women embarked for a six-month deployment.
          </p>
          <p>
           During our time on the
           <i>
            Melbourne
           </i>
           as part of a parliamentary exchange program with my colleagues the member for Bruce and the member for Hasluck, we experienced firsthand the dedicated personnel and the conditions in which they live and work. All personnel work in a particularly challenging environment, not to mention the long periods of time they spend away from their families, the high temperatures and the long days and long nights.
          </p>
          <p>
           While the total ship's company deserves acknowledgement and praise, I would like to make special mention of some personnel who helped to tell the Australian story. I was inspired by their stories. They paint a picture of the dedication, commitment, passion, professionalism and generosity of Australian sailors. Commanding Officer Rick Boulton is performing an outstanding job, demonstrating calm determination as he leads the ship's company. The team works tirelessly under his leadership to identify and pursue those engaged in arms smuggling. This is a strategic operation that requires the combined skills of all on board. The region is plagued with piracy and arms smuggling, and many ships having to create their own citadels to protect themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lieutenant Commander Joanna Floyd, the supply officer, hosted me while I was on board. Her diligence and attention to detail ensure that the morale of the ship's company is high. It may seem a small thing to those of us who can pop down to the corner shop to pick up supplies we forgot or need to replace, but it is a long way to shore from the middle of the ocean if you run out of milk or butter, so her job is indeed vital to ensuring the morale of the crew. Her creativity and ability to enlist others in her quests add further value to morale. One such example was
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Sunday" rel="nofollow">
            Easter Sunday
           </a>
           : finding ourselves on board, Joanna and her team had ensured that chocolate Easter eggs had been stored before they embarked for everyone's enjoyment—a small touch, but it made a big difference.
          </p>
          <p>
           These men and women sacrifice time with their families to serve our nation. It is not a particularly easy job for the families back home, who have increased pressures and responsibilities. With these come significant sacrifices for all. For example, while we were on board, Willem, the eight-year-old son of one of the fathers who cooked hot cross buns for us, was hospitalised. Hearing this dad's story, hearing him talk about the challenges he faced—not being able to visit his son, having to talk to his wife and his other children about how they were coping from a distance, his wife having to cope and respond to the emergency on her own—tells a story that all the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
            Defence Force
           </a>
           have to face. I also had the privilege of meeting two mothers on board. As a mother myself I found it inspiring to see the work that these women do on behalf of our nation. One, Petty Officer Collier, works as a supervising avionics technician and has two beautiful children. Leading Seaman Audhem is the mother of a relatively young toddler, and she told me this was the first deployment and the first time that she had left her child at home. We hugged each other. I think that they are amazing.
          </p>
          <p>
           In true Anzac tradition, three

           personnel are also on board and have been doing a great job driving the boats and supporting the boarding teams.
          </p>
          <p>
           Finally, I would like to mention that recently, in a newsletter to the families, Commanding Officer Boulton relayed this message: 'I am particularly proud to introduce this letter by announcing that Warrant Officer Fawbert was awarded the

            , particularly their work against piracy and smuggling. I have to say that it was a life-changing and extremely enlightening experience for me to spend some time on

            last year. Imagine, if you will, a 39-hour series of flights to get to Aqaba in the Middle East, arriving in the hot, dark night, the palm trees swaying, the evening lit up by people having coffees with their friends; and then getting our documents translated into Arabic, meeting with local officials—smoke curling tendril like to the ceiling—as we finalised our access out of Jordan and onto the Australian ship.
           </p>
           <p>
            As we passed the third checkpoint with the machine guns and the fine, fit young men who were there to provide support defence, I saw a sight I will never forget: Commander Brett Sonter in his full-whites Middle East rig standing at the top of the gangway to welcome me aboard at midnight. He had entertained local people, doing that important part of the work that the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
             Royal Australian Navy
            </a>
            do in terms of quiet diplomacy and understanding the nature of things that are emerging in the area which is so vital to our understanding of our operations there and so vital to understanding our connections with each other as human beings across these bridges.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once on the ship, I went down into a mess of 15 women. By a small red light, I fumbled in my bag in the darkness. In the morning, when I was able to see a little better but not much because it was a watchman's mess, there were 15 small lockers, and I mean small lockers—the same size as school lockers. This was an insight into the extremely spartan conditions in which the men and women who serve our national interests in the Royal Australian Navy in the Middle East live.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the time that I was on the ship with these amazing young men and women, officers, seamen and sea women, I tried to live as they do so that I could develop an understanding. I do not think I will ever quite forget sorting the rubbish at the back of the ship. Nor will I forget chopping up food and preparing things in the junior mess. But I have to say that one of the most lasting impressions was a conversation that I had with 12 young men and women who were on that ship from the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
             Central Coast
            </a>
            . Having found out that I was from the Central Coast, they had a lot of agency themselves and got together and asked if we might have a meeting to discuss things back home. They were very happy to let me know that, while they were giving of themselves in the service of our nation in the cause of freedom, they were very, very aware of the risks involved in the work they do in trying to suppress piracy and in trying to make sure that they interrupt the smuggling of drugs and arms across the region. They were thinking of their families at home. They were interested in developments in the main street of Gosford. In particular they let me know of their concern about postnatal depression amongst women who had given birth while their husbands were away. They spoke to me about the power of new technologies and what Skype had done to change their sense of connection with home while being deeply proud of their service overseas. That was quite an amazing morning.
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing that I found quite overwhelming was the youth and the incredible standard of professionalism—whether it was the people who prepared the helicopter to fly off the ship, those who flew it, those who did the communication, those who were incredibly fit and spent hour after hour every day preparing so that they were in a fit condition to board vessels at appropriate times, the surveillance team, the team who worked the mess, the engineers and the amazing engineering that they keep running all the time, the fire wardens who protect health and safety, or the chaplain—a man of generous nature—it was an overwhelmingly empowering experience for me. I felt so proud to be an Australian and so proud of those who serve our nation and our commitment to being good global citizens.

The threat of terrorism is still very real. Terrorists do not play by the rules—they strike anywhere, anytime, usually with deadly outcomes. Additionally, our Navy is playing a vital role in stopping people smugglers at the start of the chain of events which so often lead to the Australian Navy intercepting illegal boat arrivals off the northern coast of Australia.
