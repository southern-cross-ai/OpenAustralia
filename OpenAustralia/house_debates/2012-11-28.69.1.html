        My question is to the Minister for

        </a>
        and

        </a>
        and Minister for Industry and Innovation. Why is the government's support for the automotive industry important for car manufacturers as they plan for the future? Have there been any recent comments by the industry that reflect this importance?

         I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. He represents many people employed in the automotive manufacturing centre. In fact, there are about a quarter of a million Australians employed in the automotive industry. It is unquestionably the bedrock of Australia's manufacturing industry. This Labor government is supporting the car industry through difficult times with our $5.4 billion new car plan. That support is vital. It was confirmed yesterday by the managing director of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Holden" rel="nofollow">
          General Motors Holden
         </a>
         in Australia, Mr Mike Devereux, who stated that, without that government assistance, there would be no car-making capacity or car industry in this country at all.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to record that in March
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM" rel="nofollow">
          GM
         </a>
         Holden committed more than $1 billion over the next 10 years to keep building cars in this country, supported by an investment by state and federal governments totalling $275 million. In fact, Mr Devereux said yesterday that, if that government support was removed, Holden would then review its investment commitment. He also remarked that comments by those in the coalition, creating uncertainty about the future, were creating significant doubts about that investment.
        </p>
        <p>
         What is the policy of those opposite? What is it? We know the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          North Sydney
         </a>
         has been going around saying that he is opposed to support for the car industry at all. The member for Sturt has condemned Mr Devereux's comments, creating further uncertainty. We know the policy position of the Leader of the Opposition is to cut $1½ billion from the new car plan.

              As the member for Indi leaves the chamber, I will say that she commented today that she was not sure that the coalition did have a policy but that they will try to have one by the time of the next election. What a joke! A quarter of a million people depend upon this industry and you have different members of the coalition espousing different policy positions and creating investment uncertainty. That is exactly what
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Holden" rel="nofollow">
               General Motors Holden
              </a>
              were commenting upon.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let's make something absolutely clear: this side, Labor, supports the car industry and supports the people who work within it and that side, the coalition, do not support the industry and will not support the people who are employed in it. They have already pocketed the $1½ billion in savings to fill their $75 billion black hole. All of their claims are completely unbelievable. They are going to cost people their jobs.
