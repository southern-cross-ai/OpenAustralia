       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That Ms A. E. Burke be elected Deputy Speaker of this House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, I start by adding my congratulations to your elevation to the chair. I am delighted to nominate Anna as Deputy Speaker of this House. Anna was previously Deputy Speaker in this place between 12 February 2008 and 28 September 2010. Anna served in this role with great distinction, great tolerance and great dignity. Anna was first elected as the federal member for Chisholm at the 1998 election. Anna's electorate knows that she is an incredibly hardworking, diligent and tenacious member of parliament. I know her electorate will be pleased that she has again been nominated as Deputy Speaker. Anna's motto on her website is: I am here to help. She believes in it and has demonstrated it. She does everything she can to assist members of the local community, no matter how large or small their problems or their concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the distinguishing features about Anna is that she is a highly successful campaigner and advocate. For instance, in 2005 she played a major role in this place in protecting people from unwanted telemarketing calls by moving a private member's bill in parliament to create a 'national do not call list', which pressured the former government into adopting her policy. In recent times Anna has campaigned against human trafficking. Anna has become a leader on this important issue. Between 500,000 and four million people are trafficked internationally each year. In recent weeks she has met with various groups in her electorate to discuss the 'Don't Trade Lives' campaign. For me, it has always been great to see Anna's passion and commitment when she takes on an issue like this which concerns many Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anna has also been active in several other local and national campaigns and has been widely praised for her efforts to raise awareness of anaphylaxis and eating disorders. Currently, Anna is Chair of the

        , Environment and the Arts, the Standing Committee on Petitions and is on the Speaker's Panel.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is and has been a great honour, Anna, to work with you. You are respected for your passion, your dedication and your hard work—all skills I know you will bring to bear in your role as Deputy Speaker. It is a great honour, Anna, for me to nominate you as Deputy Speaker and I wish you every success in this position.

        <p>
         I endorse the words of the member for Holt in seconding this nomination of the member for Chisholm for Deputy Speaker. I would also like to indicate my respect for the retiring Speaker,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Jenkins" rel="nofollow">
          Harry Jenkins
         </a>
         . I think he has been a great Speaker for this place. He served in the role with great distinction. Of course, we all know that is a family tradition. I give him my best wishes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Chisholm will make an outstanding Deputy Speaker. I have served in this parliament with her for just over 13 years now. She has always been a woman of considerable integrity, sound judgment and good humour. I think the parliament will be well served by such a person as Anna in that job and I have no hesitation in recommending her for the position.

           That Mr Scott be elected Deputy Speaker of this House.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mr Speaker, I congratulate you in your elevation to the office of Speaker. I nominate the member for Maranoa as Deputy Speaker. It strikes me as passing strange that the member for Chisholm would be nominated for Deputy Speaker when in fact she did not regard itself as being worthy to be the Speaker of the parliament but regards herself as being qualified to be the Deputy Speaker of the parliament. The only reason I nominate the member for Maranoa is that, in order to display any consistency, you would expect the member for Chisholm not to be able to take the role of Deputy Speaker if she is not capable of being the Speaker of the parliament. I nominate the member for Maranoa for that reason and also because the member for Maranoa is exactly the kind of person who should fill the role of Deputy Speaker in this parliament. The member for Maranoa has been on the Speaker's panel for almost 10 years. He was a minister for five years and he was the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence for three years. In fact, he has been the Second Deputy Speaker since 12 February 2008. I think all members of the parliament would agree with me that the member for Maranoa has served in the role as Second Deputy Speaker, as minister, as chairman of parliamentary committees, as deputy chairman of parliamentary committees and as the member for Maranoa for 21 years with distinction, ability and integrity. I know that if the parliament has the confidence and the sense to elect a member who wishes to be Deputy Speaker and who has the ability and the intention to back their worthiness for that role then he will fulfil the role with great ability.
          </p>
          <p>
           It would surprise me if the Labor Party were to elect the member for Chisholm as the Deputy Speaker when the member for Chisholm has already indicated to the parliament that she does not believe she is capable of being the Speaker. So I would ask the parliament to elect the member for Maranoa as the Deputy Speaker and, if he should be elected, I wish him the best in that role.

               On a point of order, Mr Speaker, it is apparent that one member of the House did not vote. This was a process whereby the ballot was called open and the ballot closed. If members of the House of Representatives do not know how to vote then it is unreasonable that, if an ordinary citizen turns up at an electoral polling booth at five past six, they do not get to just put by hand a ballot paper to the returning officer. There was a process before the House. People were given ballot papers. They got to write their name on the ballot paper. They then got to put it in a box.
