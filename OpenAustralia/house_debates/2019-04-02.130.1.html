       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight, I announce that the Budget is back in the black and Australia is back on track.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the first time in 12 years, our nation is again paying its own way.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have made real progress, but we know the job is not done.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is stronger than it was when we came to government six years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Growth is higher.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unemployment is lower.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are fewer people on welfare.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are a record number of Australians with a job.
       </p>
       <p>
        School and hospital funding are at record levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        And the Budget is stronger.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is our record.
       </p>
       <p>
        But Australia does face some serious challenges.
       </p>
       <p>
        The global economy is slowing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Communities are feeling the impacts of flood, fire and drought.
       </p>
       <p>
        Families face cost of living pressures.
       </p>
       <p>
        And every one of us wants to see wages growing faster.
       </p>
       <p>
        But let me be clear: the answer to these challenges is not higher taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The answer is a stronger and more competitive economy, with lower taxes and more jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Budget builds on our plan for a stronger economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        A stronger economy that benefits you – your family, your business, your community, your country.
       </p>
       <p>
        The plan
       </p>
       <p>
        The plan I outline tonight does this in three ways.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, it restores our nation's finances. Without increasing taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, it strengthens our economy and creates more jobs through a significant new skills and infrastructure agenda. Without increasing taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        And third, it guarantees essential services like hospitals, schools and aged care, while tackling the cost of living.
       </p>
       <p>
        All without increasing taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our plan is shaped by our values.
       </p>
       <p>
        And our values embrace all Australians. Not just some of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        We believe in:
       </p>
       <p>
        Reward for effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        The power of aspiration and enterprise.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upholding personal responsibility.
       </p>
       <p>
        And always providing a helping hand to those who need it.
       </p>
       <p>
        We want Australians to have a go and we want Australians to get a fair go.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our commitment to fairness means the next generation not having to pick up the tab for the last.
       </p>
       <p>
        This requires budget discipline.
       </p>
       <p>
        And this much at least we owe our children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Restoring our nation' s finances
       </p>
       <p>
        So, tonight, I am pleased to announce a budget surplus of $7.1 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        A $55 billion turnaround on the deficit we inherited six years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2020-21, a surplus of $11 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2021-22, a surplus of $17.8 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2022-23, a surplus of $9.2 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        A total of $45 billion of surpluses over the next four years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Surpluses will continue to build toward one per cent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        within a decade.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we climb the mountain and reach our goal of eliminating Commonwealth net debt by 2030 or sooner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Only one side of politics can do this, because only one side of politics has done this.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Howard
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Costello" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Costello
        </a>
        paid off Labor's debt.
       </p>
       <p>
        And tonight the Morrison Government sets a path to do it again, without increasing taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        This matters because over the last year the interest bill on the national debt was $18 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        And this was in a low interest rate environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is money that could have built 500 schools or a world-class hospital in every state and territory.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are reducing the debt and this interest bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not through higher taxes but by responsible budget management and by growing the economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Strengthening the economy
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight I am announcing the next stage in our economic plan to make Australia even stronger.
       </p>
       <p>
        Building more infrastructure to relieve the congestion in our cities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Equipping more workers with better skills to meet future needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        And lowering taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because we want Australians to earn more and we want Australians to keep more of what they earn.
       </p>
       <p>
        Delivering tax relief
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why last year we passed into law a three step plan to deliver $144 billion in personal income tax cuts.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, providing immediate relief to address cost of living pressures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, protecting income earners from bracket creep.
       </p>
       <p>
        Third, abolishing an entire tax bracket, simplifying the system, incentivising and rewarding hard work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight, I can announce that we will go even further.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two significant changes will deliver $158 billion of tax relief for hard-working Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are the largest personal income tax cuts since the Howard government.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        is more than doubling the low and middle income tax offset from 2018-19.
       </p>
       <p>
        Taxpayers earning up to $126,000 a year – including teachers, tradies and nurses – will receive a tax cut.
       </p>
       <p>
        For a single income family, this means up to $1,080 in your pocket per year.
       </p>
       <p>
        And for families on a dual income, up to $2,160.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is money that could go towards your monthly mortgage payment, your quarterly power bill or your yearly car insurance.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than 10 million taxpayers will benefit, with 4.5 million receiving the full amount.
       </p>
       <p>
        This relief will flow quickly and be available to Australians after tax returns for the 2018-19 year are submitted in 13 weeks' time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This tax relief will lift household incomes, ease cost of living pressures and boost spending at local businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second change I announce tonight delivers long-term structural reform by lowering the 32.5 per cent tax rate to 30 per cent from 1 July 2024.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will cover all taxpayers earning between $45,000 and $200,000 and will mean that 94 per cent of taxpayers will pay no more than 30 cents in the dollar.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following these changes, our tax system will remain highly progressive.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the top five per cent of taxpayers paying one third of all income tax collected.
       </p>
       <p>
        And someone earning $200,000 paying 10 times as much tax as someone on $45,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        But unlike those opposite, we believe there should be limits to the amount you are taxed.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why, under the Morrison Government, tax as a share of the economy will not rise above the 23.9 per cent cap.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will put a speed limit on taxes, while our opponents will put a speed limit on the economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, taxes will always be lower under the Coalition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Backing small business
       </p>
       <p>
        And tonight, I also announce additional tax relief for small and medium-sized businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Small businesses are the engine-room of our economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        They are integral to every local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        People running a small business put their livelihoods on the line.
       </p>
       <p>
        They start early and finish late.
       </p>
       <p>
        They manage the front desk and the back office.
       </p>
       <p>
        They pay their workers first and take their own wages last.
       </p>
       <p>
        We want small businesses to prosper, and we are backing them to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cutting their taxes to 25 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Increasing their access to finance with a new $2 billion fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ensuring small business is paid on time, both by government and big business.
       </p>
       <p>
        And from tonight the instant asset write-off will be increased and expanded.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will be increased from $25,000 to $30,000, and it can be used every time an asset under that amount is purchased.
       </p>
       <p>
        Allowing a café to get a new fridge or grill, a plumber to buy new tools or a courier a new van.
       </p>
       <p>
        The instant asset write-off will also be expanded to businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will cover an additional 22,000 businesses, employing 1.7 million Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Already more than 350,000 businesses have taken up the instant-asset write off.
       </p>
       <p>
        And now, even more will have the chance to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        Businesses are also benefiting from the free trade agreements this Government has secured.
       </p>
       <p>
        China, Japan, Korea, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and now Indonesia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight, we provide an additional $60 million for Export Market Development Grants to allow small and medium-sized businesses to capitalise on those opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        We believe in lower taxes but we also believe everyone should pay their fair share.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Government has been at the forefront of global efforts to crack down on multinational tax avoidance.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have implemented tough new laws, which helped raise more than $12 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight we provide additional support to the Tax Office to continue these efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also provide additional resources to our financial regulators following the Banking
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        This will strengthen the financial system and deliver better outcomes for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Investing in infrastructure
       </p>
       <p>
        A strong economy requires lower taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        A strong economy depends on small business.
       </p>
       <p>
        And a stronger economy needs ongoing investment in roads, rail, bridges, dams and ports.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight, I can announce that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Coalition Government
        </a>
        is boosting our infrastructure spending to $100 billion over the decade.
       </p>
       <p>
        All without increasing taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cranes, hard hats and heavy machinery will be seen across the country, as we build Australia for current and future generations.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will deliver new infrastructure projects:
       </p>
       <p>
        To ease congestion in our cities.
       </p>
       <p>
        To unlock the potential of our regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        To better manage population growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        To improve safety on our roads.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know you want to be there for the school drop off, to help the kids with their homework and to spend more time together at the dinner table.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight, I announce we are increasing the Urban Congestion Fund four-fold from $1 billion to $4 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        This fund will focus on immediate, practical measures to cut travel times within our cities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Removing bottlenecks and improving travel corridors.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will include a $500 million Commuter Car Park Fund that will improve access to public transport hubs and take thousands of cars off the roads.
       </p>
       <p>
        Central to our plan is a long-term fast-rail vision for Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        To make this vision a reality, we are providing $2 billion in this budget for fast-rail between Melbourne and Geelong, slashing travel times in half.
       </p>
       <p>
        Work is underway to develop fast-rail corridors in other areas:
       </p>
       <p>
        Sydney to Wollongong, Newcastle, Bathurst, Orange and Parkes.
       </p>

        It was this government that ended 50 years of indecision and started construction on the Nancy-Bird Walton Airport in

       </p>
       <p>
        It was this Government that committed $5 billion to build the Melbourne airport rail link.
       </p>
       <p>
        And it was this Government which is investing $1.4 billion to build Snowy 2.0.
       </p>
       <p>
        Modernising a national icon and building on the vision of Menzies and Chifley.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our regions and their vitality have always shaped the Australian story.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this budget, there is an additional:
       </p>
       <p>
        $2.2 billion for safer roads.
       </p>
       <p>
        $1 billion to improve freight routes and access to ports.
       </p>
       <p>
        $100 million for regional airports.
       </p>
       <p>
        These investments make our regions stronger and our country stronger.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past year drought and flood have taken a heavy toll on our agricultural towns and communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        These communities have shown strength and resilience, as all Australians have stood with them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Morrison government is providing $6.3 billion in drought support and $3.3 billion for those affected by flood.
       </p>
       <p>
        Expanding the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        Establishing the Future Drought Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        Extending the Farm Household Allowance.
       </p>
       <p>
        And supporting graziers through a new North Queensland Livestock Industry Recovery Agency.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight I can announce that we will establish a new $3.9 billion Emergency Response Fund that will ensure additional resourcing is available to support future natural disaster recovery efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Agriculture, like other primary industries that helped build this country, must be recognised and valued.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our economic plan is about driving all industries forward, not just a few of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Investing in skills
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, our people are our most valuable asset.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to ensure all Australians of all ages have the skills they need for the jobs of today and the jobs of tomorrow.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight I can announce a new $525 million skills package.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will create 80,000 new apprenticeships in industries with skills shortages.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will double incentive payments to employers to $8,000 per placement.
       </p>
       <p>
        And these new apprentices—including bakers, bricklayers, carpenters and plumbers—will also receive a $2,000 incentive payment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government will also work closely with industry to train Australians in areas of future high demand, including communications technology, advanced manufacturing and health services.
       </p>
       <p>
        We announce tonight 10 new training hubs connecting schools, local industries and young people in regional areas with high youth unemployment.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're also investing $62 million to boost literacy, numeracy and digital skills.
       </p>
       <p>
        And refocusing the job services model to provide more personalised support for disadvantaged job seekers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, young Australians should have every chance of success when it comes to career opportunities in the digital age.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight we provide further funding to increase participation for women and girls in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
         STEM
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Complementing our Future Female Entrepreneurs Program, which is supporting 55,000 young women.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are also backing the industries of the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're investing $9 billion this year in science, research and technology, including its commercialisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        And we established the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund, with dividends going to new clinical trials and research in areas such as tuberculosis and traumatic brain injury.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is also more than $400 million in this Budget for genomics research to unlock the secrets of our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">
         DNA
        </a>

       </p>
       <p>
        Investing in our young people
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, as I said in my first speech in this place, education is the first defence of our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is critical to our prosperity, to our harmony and to the advancement of Australia as a nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        While money is important, so too is the quality of education afforded to all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under our government, funding for public, independent and Catholic schools is at an all-time high and will continue to grow substantially in the decade ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are committing around $300 billion to all schools, a total increase of 63 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a real dividend from a strong economy and comes without increasing taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        No one knows the needs of a local school better than the school community itself, its parents and its teachers.
       </p>
       <p>
        So tonight's Budget includes a new local school community program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Funding will be available for projects such as upgrades to libraries, classrooms and play equipment.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Budget also includes a new scholarship program for over 1,000 students to study in regional Australia each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        We want our children to get the best possible start in life.
       </p>
       <p>
        So tonight, I am announcing $453 million to once again extend pre-school education, enabling 350,000 children to receive 15 hours of quality early learning per week in the year before school.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will continue to work with the states and territories to support a longer-term plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lower taxes, more infrastructure, better skills and a quality education.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is our plan for a stronger economy that will help our nation reach its potential and enable every Australian to reach theirs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Guaranteeing essential services
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, a strong economy is not an end in itself. It's what you do with it that counts.
       </p>
       <p>
        With a strong economy, we can guarantee the essential services that Australians need and deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        Health is front of mind for all Australians, and this year the Government will spend more than $80 billion on healthcare.
       </p>
       <p>
        An amount that has increased every year we have been in government.
       </p>
       <p>
        More

       </p>
       <p>
        More funding for mental health.
       </p>
       <p>
        Better access to dental services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Better access to hospitals.
       </p>
       <p>
        And better access to regional

       </p>
       <p>
        In this Budget, we are:
       </p>
       <p>
        Funding upgrades to regional hospitals, the first being in Townsville.
       </p>
       <p>
        Establishing Australia's first comprehensive children's cancer centre in Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        Helping to build a new Brain and Spinal Ward in

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In this Budget, we also list more medicines on the PBS to treat kidney, bladder, liver and skin cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        And tonight, we announce the listing of Besponsa, a medicine for people with acute Leukaemia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead of costing $120,000 a course, patients will now have access to the medicine at a cost of only $6.50 per script for concession card holders and around $40 for general patients.
       </p>
       <p>
        This brings the total number of new listings to more than 2,000 since we came to government, costing more than $10 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        A real and profound dividend from a strong economy, and done without increasing taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Coalition, Medicare is guaranteed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bulk-billing is at a record high.
       </p>
       <p>
        And we are adding new services to the Medicare Benefits Schedule, including diagnostic imaging for breast cancer and heart health checks.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're establishing a Heart Kids Project for new research to treat and prevent heart disease which affects thousands of Australian children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, mental health is an issue of deep concern to all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a national tragedy that we lose so many people to suicide and that so many people live a life of quiet desperation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight I say: we hear you and we are with you.
       </p>
       <p>
        This issue demands our ongoing attention and resources.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must work together to combat youth suicide as a national priority.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this Budget, the Government will invest $461 million in Australia's most significant youth mental health and suicide prevention strategy.
       </p>
       <p>
        30 new headspace centres.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reduced waiting lists.
       </p>
       <p>
        More support for Indigenous youth including through mentoring and peer support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Treatment for early psychosis.
       </p>
       <p>
        A perinatal mental health program.
       </p>
       <p>
        And extra counselling services for communities who have suffered from natural disasters.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of this is about looking after each other.
       </p>
       <p>
        It reflects the best of Australia and its values.
       </p>
       <p>
        Looking after older Australians
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, a stronger economy also allows us to invest more in looking after older Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians deserve to age with dignity and have earned the right to expect the highest standards of aged care services.
       </p>
       <p>
        In some cases, these services have badly let Australians down.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why we established the Royal Commission into aged care.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Budget includes a significant investment of $725 million that will deliver:
       </p>
       <p>
        10,000 new home care packages.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bringing to 40,000 the number of new packages announced over the last 18 months.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additional financial support for residential care.
       </p>
       <p>
        A capital works program with a focus on regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        And a series of new measures to improve the quality and safety of aged care services.
       </p>
       <p>
        We achieve this without increasing taxes and without raiding retirees' hard earned savings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, we also recognise the pressure energy bills place on those who can least afford it.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why we are providing additional cost of living relief for pensioners through a one-off Energy Assistance Payment of $75 for singles and $125 for couples.
       </p>
       <p>
        This payment will be paid this financial year and comes on top of other actions the Government has taken to reduce power bills.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, we know that carers are our nation's unsung heroes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their job is 24/7 and emotionally as well as physically demanding.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many carers need and deserve a rest.
       </p>
       <p>
        So tonight we are announcing $84 million to enable carers to leave a loved one in safe hands and get a much needed break.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, supporting people with disability is a moral imperative, recognised by both sides of this House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Growing to $22 billion, it takes a strong economy to fund the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        fully and sustainably.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is what our Government has done.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this Budget, we have also set aside half a billion dollars for a Royal Commission into the mistreatment of people with disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        Affordable housing is another priority for this Government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just over a week ago, the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, established by this Government, successfully issued the largest social bond in Australia's history.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over $300 million was raised, providing a significant injection into the community housing sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        Protecting our environment
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, we all have an important responsibility to protect our environment and address climate change.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Budget includes a $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Package – $2 billion of which will go to practical emission reduction activities, working with farmers and Indigenous communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through our measures, as we have done in the past, we will beat our international emissions reduction targets.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians have been gifted a precious inheritance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight I announce a $100 million new Environment Restoration Fund to deliver large-scale environmental projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        Protecting the habitats of our threatened species, our coasts, our waterways and cleaning up waste.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will complement a new Communities' Environment Program, providing smaller grants for projects that target local community priorities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ensuring safe communities
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, all Australians have a right to feel safe in their community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the largest Commonwealth investment in women's safety, in this Budget we are providing $328 million to fund prevention, response and recovery initiatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bringing our total investment in this area to $840 million since we came to government.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is new funding for the 1800RESPECT helpline, more safe places and training for health and other service providers.
       </p>
       <p>
        But we must also change attitudes, as the path to violence begins with disrespect.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Budget also provides for a new round of the Safer Communities Fund, assisting religious organisations, schools and other organisations to install fencing, lighting and security cameras.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also have to do more to keep our kids safe online and tackle cyber-bullying.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as we teach our kids how to cross the street, we now need to teach them how to sensibly and safely use the web.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this Budget, we are funding new practical training to give kids, parents and teachers the knowledge and skills necessary to keep our children safe online.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, the Government's cashless debit card is delivering life-changing outcomes in child welfare and the safety of communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        And so, in this Budget, we extend its roll out to other areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is already making a real difference, halving the frequency of alcohol consumption, gambling and drug abuse.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, drugs like ice and heroin have a devastating impact on families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight, we announce $337 million in new funding for our comprehensive drug strategy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cracking down on outlaw motorcycle gangs and their drug supply chains.
       </p>
       <p>
        And improving treatment and rehabilitation services to support those affected by the scourge of drugs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our law enforcement agencies are also on the front line of countering terrorism and extremism.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are providing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Federal Police
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        with $570 million to keep Australians safe from these threats.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this budget, we are also allocating an additional $680 million to support our service men and women deployed abroad.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, our Government also recognises the importance of supporting our veterans.
       </p>
       <p>
        They have served our nation, defending our values and our interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this budget we are adding to the $278 million invested in our last two budgets to improve the wellbeing of our veterans and their families.

        Economic outlook
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, the fundamentals of the Australian economy are sound, but there are genuine and clear risks emerging both at home and abroad.
       </p>
       <p>
        The residential housing market has cooled, credit growth has eased and we are yet to see the full impact of flood and drought on the economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Global trade tensions remain, the Chinese economy has slowed and there has been a loss of momentum in Japan, Europe and other advanced economies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding these challenges, it is a testament to the strength of the Australian economy that it is in its 28th year of consecutive economic growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our economic plan will see this continue.
       </p>
       <p>
        GDP growth is expected to pick up to 2¾ per cent in 2019-20.
       </p>
       <p>
        We delivered ahead of schedule on our promise to create one million new jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        And we now commit to creating a further 1.25 million new jobs over the next five years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, six years ago when we came to government:
       </p>
       <p>
        The economy was weakening, unemployment was rising and the budget was deteriorating.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since then, we have made the right choices, the difficult but necessary choices and our economic plan is working.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight marks the next stage in that plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first surplus in 12 years, and the first repayment made on Labor's debt.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lower taxes for 10 million Australians and three million small businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        80,000 new apprenticeships.
       </p>
       <p>
        A $100 billion National Infrastructure Plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Record spending on schools and hospitals.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have done all of this without increasing taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian people can trust that:
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Coalition, the economy will always be stronger, allowing you and your family to get ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Coalition, our borders will always be more secure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Coalition, there will always be more jobs and lower taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        And under the Coalition, essential services will always be guaranteed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, tonight we have set the course for an even better and brighter Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend this Budget to the House.
       </p>
