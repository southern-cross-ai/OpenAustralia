        (c)meeting with the Chinese Vice-Minister for Land and Resources accompanied by executives of Nimrod Resources;

       <p class="italic">
        (a)before he travelled to China in August 2014, the Minister for Human Services did not advise Australian officials that he was to meet with the Chinese Vice-Minister for Land and Resources accompanied by executives of Nimrod Resources;

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d)the Minister for Human Services has already admitted to the House that he was travelling in a personal capacity when he assisted Nimrod Resources during his trip to China, and therefore, his actions were a direct breach of Clause 2.20 of the Prime Minister’s own Statement of Ministerial Standards; and
       </p>

            I raise a point of order. The Leader of the House has already been warned. We are in a situation now where the government has done what no previous parliament has done. Every one of these resolutions gets gagged. He cannot shut down debate and then use points of order in that way and get away with it.

             has already been warned. The member for Wakefield will not interject when I am making a ruling. I remind the Manager of Opposition Business and the Leader of the House about some of the language. I have pointed out the language in the Leader of the Opposition's question. I have not warned the Leader of the House; I have asked him to cease

             . The Leader of the House should have come to the point on leave being granted or not granted—and I am going to ask him to state whether leave is granted or not granted in the second—but I will say to the Manager of Opposition Business that I am allowing free flowing, robust debate, and if the Manager of Opposition Business wants me to pick up on every instance he will find that there have been a number that I did not pick up, particularly in preambles to questions, including from the member for Sydney yesterday. I am going to ask the Leader of the House to simply state whether leave is granted or not granted.

                 It is time for this do-nothing Prime Minister to do something. He must sack the minister.

It is not the job of this government to back in its donors and to hide the minister. He should go.
