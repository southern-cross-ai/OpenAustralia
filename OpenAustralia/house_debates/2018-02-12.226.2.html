       </p>
       <p>
        Australia Day honours recipients reflect the best of our country. Australia's honours system allows us to shine a spotlight on our role models. Not only does it give us a chance to say, 'Thank you for your service,' but the recipients serve as a reminder of everything we can and should aspire to be. This Australia Day, I was proud to see Berowra residents being appointed to the Order of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Diana O'Halloran, from Glenorie, was made an officer of the Order of Australia for her contribution to medicine and general practice. Diana's pioneering work in the field of general practice in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        has included her ongoing advocacy for reform in the provision of accessible, high-quality health care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Judith Horton, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Dural" rel="nofollow">
         Middle Dural
        </a>
        , was appointed to the Order of Australia for her contribution to horticulture and gardening. Judith has been involved in the Australian open gardens scheme, has edited

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yates_Garden_Guide" rel="nofollow">
          Yates Garden Guide
         </a>
        </i>
        and has helped grow the Galston District Garden Club, which runs the popular Galston Open Gardens Weekend every spring. Berowra's bushland is a fitting home for a woman of Judith's talents. We're lucky to count her as one of our own.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rosalind Carlson, from Arcadia, was recognised for her service to choral music and education. Rosalind's desire to impress a love of music on others has enriched the musical life of both Berowra and our nation. Rosalind wears many hats as an accomplished musical writer, performer and conductor—thus it's only fitting that she now adds Order of Australia recipient to her list of titles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Julie Griffin, from Westleigh, was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for her tremendous service to women in Hornsby and Ku-ring-gai. As a survivor of domestic violence, Julie's passion and drive have seen her involved in the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai domestic violence network for 25 years. Three years ago, she helped launch the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Shelter" rel="nofollow">
         Women's Shelter
        </a>
        . Julie is a source of great motivation for the many women she works with, and her award is a fitting thankyou to someone who makes a difference.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rev" rel="nofollow">
         The Rev
        </a>
        . Dr David Claydon, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsby_Heights" rel="nofollow">
         Hornsby Heights
        </a>
        , was honoured for his service to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Anglican Church
        </a>
        , interfaith relations and refugees. David Claydon, I'm proud to say, has been a family friend for generations. He has been a much-loved Anglican minister in Berowra, and he and his wife Robyn are admired internationally for their work with Christians and for their great humanity. David and Robyn Claydon have travelled to more than 80 countries for their work with an impressive array or organisations, including human rights organisations for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        and Africa. I often speak to David about interfaith and ecumenical works in this place. The recognition of David's work locally, nationally and, indeed, internationally is richly deserved. Unfortunately, David's recovering from major heart surgery. We wish him well for a speedy recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two other Australia Day honourees from my community also deserve special mention. Craig Easy from Hornsby was awarded the Australian Fire Services Medal for his contribution to the Fire &amp; Rescue
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        over many years. Our firefighters, like Craig, are the backbone of this nation. And mathematics teacher Eddie Woo, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherrybrook_Technology_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Cherrybrook Technology High School
        </a>
        , was named
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia's_Local_Hero" rel="nofollow">
         Australia's Local Hero
        </a>
        for his innovative and inclusive teaching methods. His 'Wootube' videos began as a way of keeping a student with cancer engaged and educated during his illness. What began for an intended audience of one has now evolved into an internet sensation, providing thousands of people with the opportunity to further their education and learn a love for maths.
       </p>
       <p>
        Outside my electorate, I would like to make special mention of three other honourees who have personally inspired me. Danny Lamm's contribution to Australia-Israel relations was quite rightly recognised. I worked alongside Danny on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Executive Council
        </a>
        of Australian Jewry. I know firsthand how deserving Danny is.
       </p>
       <p>
        Greg Whitby's innovative and passionate work with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Catholic Education
        </a>
        over many years was recognised. I valued his experience during my work at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Catholic_University" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Catholic University
        </a>
        , and I continue to benefit from his counsel as Director of Education in the Parramatta Diocese.
       </p>
       <p>
        My friend Brian Loughnane worked with every Liberal leader since 1994, and served both as the Victorian and federal director of my party, running outstanding campaign wins in 2004 and 2013. He has a well-deserved international reputation as being an outstanding political strategist. There are two sorts of people who become federal or state director: those for whom it's just a job and those who believe in the cause deeply. Brian is very much in the latter category. Turning 18 on that glorious day when
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
         Gough Whitlam
        </a>
        was sacked, Brian used to maintain a list of 100 reasons why
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_McMahon" rel="nofollow">
         Billy McMahon
        </a>
        was a better Prime Minister than Gough Whitlam. It was a list to which he was adding constantly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Equally at home amongst seasoned campaigners or liberal and conservative intellectuals, Brian understood that the party operates in a broader cultural environment of global ideas and political activism in the liberal and conservative tradition. I was honoured that Brian's last function as federal director was addressing my branch in 2016 and that he came and helped me on my campaign. Brian Loughnane,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Officer of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        , I salute you.
       </p>
       <p>
        All the people I have mentioned contributed in their own way. So it's right that we as a parliament take time to recognise great Australians who serve our nation in the way that they do.

          </a>
          and the Hawkesbury, we also honour dedicated and hardworking citizens in a number of ways. In the Hawkesbury,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Webb" rel="nofollow">
           Peter Webb
          </a>
          was named Hawkesbury's Citizen of the Year. He has worked tirelessly with the Suicide Prevention &amp; Support Network
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
           Western Sydney
          </a>
          . He is also involved in the organisation of this Sunday's Hope Walk at Clarendon. His aim has been to break the stigma of mental illness, support people who've considered suicide and provide support to those who've lost someone to suicide. Adam Higgins of Blaxlands Ridge was recognised as Young Citizen of the Year, thanks to his involvement with the Rural Fire Service Cadet Program at Colo High School, where he has served as senior deputy cadet for the last two years.
         </p>
         <p>
          The work to establish Pink Finns earned Jodie Amor the Volunteer of the Year Award. Jodie and her team assist women and their families dealing with cancer. The Blue Datto Foundation, established by the Vassallo family in memory of their son, Philip, was recognised as Community Organisation of the Year. Their educational program, Keeping Safe, has brought driver safety to the forefront of schools across Western Sydney.
         </p>

          The Local Hero in the Hawkesbury was

           North Richmond
          </a>
          . His efforts in rescuing and performing
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPR" rel="nofollow">
           CPR
          </a>
          on this child changed her future and her family's future. Both Jacki-Lynn Griffiths and 10-year-old Lily Spies received the Environmental Award. Ms Griffiths has been rescuing local wildlife for the past 20 years, while Ms Spies's school project on the impact of single-use plastic bags inspired her to take up the issue with local council.
         </p>
         <p>
          The St Matthews Bicentennial Team received the Hawkesbury Cultural Award for their brilliant celebration of the church and its parish. And, as the eye at many local events, Hawkesbury Camera Club were celebrated through the Hawkesbury Community Arts Award. In terms of the Order of Australia medal, my friend former councillor Christine Paine was honoured for her 25 years of passionate and dedicated service as a local Hawkesbury councillor. We all know how much she deserved that award. Each of these citizens and organisations contribute to the strong and vibrant fabric that holds the Hawkesbury community together and reminds us of how lucky we are to be part of that community.
         </p>
         <p>
          On Australia Day, the Blue Mountains recognises its citizens who give of themselves for their community and they award three local citizen of the year awards. Carmel Higgins was named Blue Mountains Citizen of the Year, recognising almost 50 years of service to St Finbar's Netball Club, and the Blue Mountains Netball Association. Carmel began as coach for the club in 1970 and has served in virtually every executive position, including president. Most recently, she was involved in the Walking Netball project, which allows women to continue to play their beloved sport even as their knees grow older. Young Citizen of the Year was
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gunn" rel="nofollow">
           Andrew Gunn
          </a>
          , in recognition of his service as a youth counsellor. In this role, he's used the Youth Summit Radio program to raise awareness about issues of youth homelessness, abuse, mental health and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQI" rel="nofollow">
           LGBTQI

          rights. The Springwood Foundation Day committee has organised the formal celebrations of the town's heritage over the past 20 years. They were awarded the Community Achievement of the Year Award for their efforts in fundraising through this event and contributing to the vibrancy of the local area.
         </p>
         <p>
          Four people in the Blue Mountains received Australia Day honours. Heather Gwilliam of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Riverview" rel="nofollow">
           Mount Riverview
          </a>
          and Ian Ellis, known as 'Ike', of Springwood, were both awarded the

           Order of Australia Medal
          </a>
          . Ms Gwilliam has been a volunteer with Anglicare Disaster Recovery and Gateway, which provides resources for local families. I certainly benefitted from her leadership during the 2013 bushfires. Ian Ellis, a former
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">

          Police Force and a hostage negotiator, was instrumental in the development of alternative approaches for young offenders. They're both to be congratulated. Dr Caroline Bowen of

           Wentworth Falls
          </a>

           Member of the Order of Australia

          . This shows just how vital having good speech is, and Dr Bowen has done a lot of work in this area.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Conspicuous Service Cross was awarded to Chaplain (
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Commodore" rel="nofollow">

           RAAF

           I thank my good friend the member for Berowra for the opportunity to recognise some of our great Australians this year. This year in the electorate of Fisher, the hard work and bravery of our local emergency services personnel was recognised.

           Along with these great Australians in my electorate of Fisher, we are proud to have the Thompson Institute. I've spoken often in this place about the cutting edge work that is going on there in mental health research and treatment, and about the $5 million that the Turnbull government delivered to support that great work. What I've not spoken about is the man who the Thompson Institute is named after,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Thompson" rel="nofollow">
            Roy Thompson
           </a>
           . Roy, along with his wife, Nola, are two of the Sunshine Coast's greatest philanthropists.
          </p>
          <p>
           Like many great Australian stories, Roy's began in humble circumstances: in a single-income family with a father working hard in the local gasworks. Things were not much better for the Thompsons in the 1970s, when Roy and Nola brought up their eight children on a modest builder's wage. But in the end Australia rewards hard work, imagination and commitment. Roy went into real estate and he had a great deal of success creating or transforming a host of Sunshine Coast landmarks, like Chifley's Hotel, along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
           The list of the Thompsons' contribution to our community is long, but they have focused their generosity on education. To date, they have donated more than $15 million to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
            University of the Sunshine Coast
           </a>
           alone. Their first donations created 150 bursaries, providing regular financial support for students who otherwise would be unable to finish their degrees. Their donations have been as creative as they are generous. They've provided half of the money for a new multistorey car park for the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC" rel="nofollow">
            USC
           </a>
           as a means of raising further and ongoing funds for scholarships and bursaries. This car park project is predicted to provide $69 million, benefitting more than 1,000 students in the coming years.
          </p>
          <p>
           Most recently, their $10 million donation for the Thompson Institute, supported by a further $5 million from the federal government, has allowed this cutting-edge facility to be built and to begin treating patients. The facility is now up and running and is just about to take delivery of the next-generation
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI" rel="nofollow">
            MRI
           </a>
           machine which the Thompsons have paid for. This year, the facility is expected to treat 6,000 patients suffering from mental illness as well as making breakthroughs in mental health research. Away from the USC, I can tell the chamber that Roy also provided the land back in the 1980s which allowed the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_Maris" rel="nofollow">
            Stella Maris
           </a>
           school on the coast to go ahead, and he continues to support Stella Maris's work to this day. I'm delighted to say that, in this year's
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
            Australia Day
           </a>
           honours Roy was made a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Companion of the Order of Australia
           </a>
           . On behalf of the people of the Sunshine Coast, I want to congratulate Roy on his well-deserved honour and to thank him again for everything he has done for our community.
          </p>
          <p>
           For each person who's awarded an honour, there are a great many dedicated volunteers, friends, colleagues and family members who make these achievements possible. I also want to do my bit to recognise those unsung heroes. That's why I've created the Fisher Community Awards. I want to help make the southern and central part of the Sunshine Coast the place to be for education, employment and retirement. My community awards recognise individuals and organisations who are leading the way in making that a reality with their contributions. I'm calling for public nominations for each of my nine categories covering students, teachers, education providers, businesses, employees and innovators, senior community groups and senior service providers. I strongly encourage residents of Fisher to get involved by going to my 'Get Involved' page and nominating someone today.

            I thank the member for Berowra for bringing this motion forward for debate. It provides an opportunity for members to further acknowledge people in our communities who have made a contribution to the greater good. This year's Order of Australia awards have recognised three very worthy recipients in my electorate of Fremantle. Dr Philip House from
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Fremantle" rel="nofollow">
             North Fremantle
            </a>
            has been appointed a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Member of the Order of Australia
            </a>
            for his service to medicine as an ophthalmologist, for his contribution to the work of eye surgery foundations and for his personal efforts in supporting eye health in Timor-Leste.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_House" rel="nofollow">
             Dr House
            </a>
            's research at the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             University of Western Australia
            </a>
            has helped to deliver a better understanding of glaucoma and of the factors that underlie poor eye health in Indigenous communities. Indeed, Dr House is rightly commended for providing eye health services to communities in the Pilbara over more than 25 years. In addition to his academic and clinical work in Australia, he has been a regular visitor to Timor-Leste, where he lends his passion, humanity and expertise in training young local doctors to provide basic eye care. It's almost impossible, I'm sure, to overstate the positive impact of that kind of work.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also take this opportunity to congratulate Victor Paino, the owner of the iconic Fremantle business Sealanes, who has received a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Medal of the Order of Australia
            </a>
            for his significant and extensive service to the seafood-retailing industry and to the broader community's welfare through his support of charitable organisations. Mr Paino is a third-generation Fremantle fisherman in a city with a proud ongoing tradition of successful and sustainable fishing. He began working in his family's shop as a 15-year-old and soon graduated to driving the truck that transported freshly caught produce from Esperance to Perth. I can tell you that is some kind of drive to do on a regular basis. Victor and his brother, working together, have taken Sealanes from a small business to a veritable seafood empire, but his success has always been premised on giving back to the community, as evidenced, for example, by his work as the founding director of the Fremantle Hospital Medical Research Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, I'm very pleased to acknowledge and celebrate the achievement of Roger Underwood, who has been appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in relation to the extensive and leading work in the areas of forestry and bushfire management. As an historian and writer, Roger Underwood has brought to his work an understanding that our relationship with the land is deeply cultural as well as scientific. Of course,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
             Indigenous Australians
            </a>
            have known for thousands of years that fire is a potent tool for land management and regeneration, as well as being a sometimes catastrophic hazard. Mr Underwood's work has drawn upon and illuminated the history of bushfire. He's been an expert on and an influential advocate for sustainable land management for 59 years, following his distinguished career as a forester and then general manager of the WA Department of Conservation and Land Management, as it was then. Mr Underwood founded the volunteer Bushfire Front group in 2003. In a state like ours, in Western Australia, his work has undoubtedly helped to save lives and conserve our natural environment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today's motion gives me the opportunity to mention the achievement of the 2018 Young Australian of the Year,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Kerr" rel="nofollow">
             Samantha Kerr
            </a>
            , who is also a Fremantle electorate constituent. She was born in East Freo and was a sporting phenomenon from a young age. She's gone on to become an national and international superstar. When she was 15, Sam was told that despite her skills she couldn't hope to play
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
             AFL
            </a>
            professionally, because those opportunities simply didn't exist for women. They do now, but didn't then. So she turned her attention to round-ball football and began a journey that has included playing for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Glory" rel="nofollow">
             Perth Glory
            </a>

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC" rel="nofollow">

            and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Red_Stars" rel="nofollow">
             Chicago Red Stars
            </a>
            , becoming, along the way, the all-time leading goal scorer in America's National Women's Soccer League. She is, arguably, the best player in the world, and I would happily make that argument. There's no doubt that Samantha Kerr is a leader within the Matildas and she's a leader and role model within the community. Her skill, athleticism, energy and dedication to the sport are an inspiration, but her character and determination are more impressive still.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll finish by making the point that the Order of Australia's honours program, like many aspects of Australian life, does need some rebalancing if it's to properly reflect the diverse make-up of our society.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
             Western Australian
            </a>
            s are consistently under-represented, but that's largely the result, or it appears to be largely the result, of the fact there are just not enough nominees from WA. I also note that across the program only one in three award recipients are women, and that ratio is even worse in relation to nominees. I encourage people in my home state and across Australia to consider the full range of potential award recipients, because I know there are lots of women, and men, who deserve to be recognised for their contributions to the greater good in many areas of our national life.

             from 2011 to 2016. He's also been a board member and state secretary of the Western Australia state branch. I thank him for his services and contribution to our veterans and their families and congratulate him on this prestigious honour.

            </p>
            <p>
             I would also like to recognise some of Tangney's business and education leaders. David Flanagan, the chair and chancellor of

             , which is located in my electorate, was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his significant service to the mining sector for a range of roles in higher education and the community. David is known for his work as a geologist and mining and mineral exploration pioneer in Western Australia. In 2014, David was named the Western Australian of the Year and Western Australian Business Leader of the Year.
            </p>
            <p>
             I join the member for Fremantle in congratulating Philip House who was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his significant service to medicine as an ophthalmologist, and his service to eye surgery foundations and the international community of Timor-Leste. Philip, who is an outstanding ophthalmologist, had the Applecross Eye Clinic in my electorate. He's also known for his extraordinary contribution to outreach services, including 25 years of services to the Pilbara in Western Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally, I'd like to congratulate someone who was a great mentor to me and who remains a mentor to me today, Brian Loughnane. Brian was made an

Brian Loughnane was then appointed Federal Director of the Liberal Party and served as campaign director for the coalition parties at the federal election held in 2004, when the coalition returned with an increased majority. Brian was also at the helm for the 2013 coalition win. He retired as Federal Director of the Liberal Party in February 2016.

             Brian Loughnane and I have worked together, Brian in the role of federal director and me in the role of state director of the WA Liberal Party. As you can imagine, despite our close friendship and mentorship, sometimes those two positions did come with particular points of difference—I would stand up for the best interests of Western Australia and Brian would, quite professionally, run a national campaign. But, through all of that, Brian has been a great mentor to me. He has also been a great mentor to my wife, Asta, who was working at the Liberal Party here in Canberra when I met her. I call Brian, as does Asta, a friend of ours. I'm so pleased that Brian has been honoured in this way. When I spoke to him, he said this honour is recognition of the hard work of many campaigners from the Liberal Party who helped contribute to the success of our party around the nation.

              I'm delighted to have the opportunity to speak today on the Australian honours system. Although I can think of a few improvements to the system, I am a great supporter of the Australian honours system. I'd like to congratulate all the recipients of this year's
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">

              honours. For any Australian, receiving an award of this magnitude will undoubtedly be one of the proudest moments of their lives, and rightly so. I'm pleased so many have been recognised for their dedication, commitment and achievement in the fields of education, the arts, sport, science and social work.
             </p>
             <p>
              In my own electorate of Brand, I would like to make special mention of Mr Gordon Hall of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
               Secret Harbour
              </a>
              , who was awarded the Emergency Services Medal for services to the community dating back to 1993, having served with the WA State Emergency Service, WA volunteer emergency services, the fire and emergency services authority, and the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
               SES
              </a>
              Volunteers Association of Western Australia. While this award may have come to him as a surprise, I am sure it is no surprise to the community that Gordon has served with distinction for 25 years. Congratulations, Gordon. I join with the rest of my electorate, the community and the rest of Western Australia in applauding your well-deserved recognition.
             </p>
             <p>
              Gordon was the only person from Brand to be recognised in the 2018
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day_Honours" rel="nofollow">
               Australia Day Honours
              </a>
              , so I will take the opportunity to reflect on the awards system more generally. Of the more than 900 people awarded honours on Australia Day, only a handful of West Australians were recognised—68 out of over 900 recipients. It is disappointing to see WA so unrepresented on the national stage, when I know that there are so many sandgropers who deserve such recognition and who offer services and knowledge that benefit not just their own communities but the rest of Australia.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also disconcerting is a lack of women recognised by the Australian honours system. Just 18 out of the 68
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
               Western Australian
              </a>
              awardees were women. Of all the recipients of Australian honours, less than a third are women, and this rate has remained stubbornly in place for some years. There have been efforts made to increase nominations and awards. There have been slight improvements. Progress is glacial. It is incumbent on everyone to nominate those among us who have achieved in their fields, served in the community and made a real difference to the lives of others. I urge Western Australians to become more proactive in nominating people for recognition and to nominate more women; although nominations alone will not necessarily see more women recognised.
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Council" rel="nofollow">
               The Council
              </a>
              of the Order of Australia fails to meet the government's aim of 50 per cent of women on boards and perhaps an effort to redress this imbalance might assist.
             </p>
             <p>
              The motion presented by the member for Berowra loyally repeats accurately the words on the website of the Governor-General that the monarch instituted the Australian honours system but, of course, in the Australian constitutional monarchy, as it is in Britain, the Queen acts only on the advice of the Prime Minister who leads the elected government of the day, except for that one time also in 1975.
             </p>
             <p>
              Prior to the Australian honours system, the states and Commonwealth made use of the imperial honours system. Labor governments stopped making nominations to this foreign system in around 1972. The federal Labor government under Prime Minister
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
               Gough Whitlam
              </a>
              created the Australian honours system, and the Queen in her ceremonial role approved it in the anachronistic way that
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
               Her Majesty
              </a>
              , her predecessors and successors, by the luck of their birth, are obliged to. The elected Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser retained Whitlam's honours system but in 1976, on the advice of the Fraser Liberal National government—because I bet it wasn't her idea—the Queen created the categories of knights and dames in the Order of Australia.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thankfully, under the elected Labor government of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
               Bob Hawke
              </a>
              , the use of imperial awards to recognise Australians ceased, as did the absurd category of knights and dames. Ultimately, conservative governments made way for Labor governments that recognised an Australian honours system awarded to Australians by Australians and which conferred great prestige and honour upon Australian citizens deserving recognition. With our belief in Australians, Labor knew this could be done without the need to turn to Britain. In fact, it took the Queen herself in 1990 via a private secretary
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William" rel="nofollow">
               Sir William
              </a>
              Heseltine to remind Australian governments that perhaps the time had come for Australia to honour its system exclusively with its own honour system. Sir William, I might add, is from Western Australia, born in Wyalkatchem, now retired in York, and was the only private secretary to the Queen who was an Australian. Perhaps if more Australians had had this role, the Queen might have let us know that, as a mature independent country, we could allow ourselves to appoint an Australian as our head of state.
             </p>
             <p>
              And let us not forget who sought to diminish the Australian honours system as recently as 2014 with the reintroduction of Australian knights and dames. Yes, Prime Minister Abbott embarrassed the nation by reintroducing the anachronistic honour of knights and dames and awarded
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip" rel="nofollow">
               Prince Philip
              </a>
              , the Queen's husband and consort, a knighthood. Yes, that actually happened. In his tone-deaf approach, Prime Minister Abbott presented the nation and four great Australians with a very awkward situation that never should have occurred.

               Today I would like to congratulate the recipients of the Order of Australia awards in the 2018

               honours within my electorate of Boothby. I thank my colleague for moving this motion so we may do so. In the Australian honours system, appointments to the Order of Australia confer the highest recognition for outstanding achievement and service. This award is the pre-eminent way Australians recognise the achievements and service of their fellow citizens, and each of these recipients was nominated directly by people within our community. This is testament to the impact the award winners and their services had on our community and the appreciation felt by their peers. This year a number of the

              </p>
              <p>
               I acknowledge the following residents of my community for their outstanding service. Professor John Turnidge was made an

               for his distinguished service to medicine as an infectious disease physician and microbiologist. The professor is particularly recognised for his contribution to the advancement of health policy in the area of antimicrobial resistance and professional medical organisations. Adjunct Professor Charlotte Champion de Crespi was made a Member of the Order of the Australia for her significant service to nursing and to nurse education, particularly in the field of drug and alcohol care and to Indigenous health projects.

               for her significant service to community health, specifically to workforce management, administration, policy reform and to medical education. Mrs Anat Kaur Sandhu was made a Member of the Order of Australia for her significant service to the restaurant and catering industry in South Australia and to the community through her support for charitable organisations.
              </p>

               Emeritus Professor Grant Townsend was made a Member of the Order of Australia:

               Ambulance Service. Mr Rhys Roberts was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for his service to the community in a range of roles. I know Mr Roberts and his family well, particularly his wonderful wife, Helen, and I was delighted to see Mr Roberts recognised for his tireless service to our community. He is known to so many people in our area through a variety of roles, whether through Lions or the Blackwood Memorial Hall to name just two.
              </p>
              <p>
               Mr Trevor Whitelaw was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia:

              <p>
               I also know Mr Whitelaw, his wife, Jo, and daughter, Stacey, well. Several events that have been particularly special and memorable to me as the member for Boothby have involved Mr Whitelaw. These include the Anzac Day service at Brighton, at which I was privileged to speak last year, and the 50th National

It was also where I famously said, 'I don't mind who wins as long as it's not the Victorians and the Victorians won!

                 I again recognise the contribution of the award recipients from Boothby for their tireless work, unrivalled commitment and personal dedication over many years. Perhaps the Prime Minister summarised their efforts best in his address to the 2018 Australian of the Year Award ceremony when he said:

                  My electorate covers more than 30,000 square kilometres, nearly half the landmass of Tasmania. And it encompasses 12 councils. I had 13, but lost two of them in the recent boundary redistribution and gained another one. So

                  and its awards have a special significance for me, with plenty of events and ceremonies to attend.

                 <p>
                  This year, I had the pleasure, amongst others, of attending Australia Day breakfasts at Westbury and Chudleigh, both of them in the

                  </a>
                  Council area. I can report faithfully to the House that I attended both breakfasts but only ate at one. I am already losing the battle of the waistline in my electorate, home to so much fruit, dairy, meat, cheese, beer and spirits, without running up the white flag by scoffing two breakfasts! My congratulations to the Deloraine Rotary and the Chudleigh residents' association for these wonderful annual events, which attract hundreds of people each year.

                  On Australia Day we honour people with memberships of the Order of Australia and with various medals. I was delighted to see

                  , who lives in the north-east coastal town of Bicheno, made a Member of the General Division. Shane's swimming achievements are legendary. As a teenager she won gold in Munich in 1972 and she has kept up her competitive swimming throughout her life. In 2003 she broke the world record for the 200-metre individual medley for 45- to 49-year-olds. Shane has been made an AM for her significant service to elite swimming and for her role in developing water safety programs in developing countries. Since moving to Tasmania, Shane has been an active community member as patron of the Devil Island Project since 2007, and founding the Devil of a Swim ocean swimming event in Bicheno in 2010.

Time prevents me naming the winners of the municipal citizens of the year, young citizens of the year and volunteers of the year across my 12 councils, but each and every one of these people deserves our thanks for the incredible work they do in our communities, across Tasmania and, indeed, across Australia.

The Australia Day honours of course are one of the pinnacles of Australian society and recognise people who have sacrificed and exercised charity and community support as well as success. We celebrate all of those things when we give out Australia Day honours and provide awards.

                    It's with pleasure that I rise to speak on the motion brought before us tonight by the member for Berowra. On 26 January this year, some 900 people from across Australia were honoured with the Order of Australia. They come from all walks of life and have undertaken all sorts of endeavours, but they all share one thing in common, and that is their exceptional contributions to their respective communities or fields of endeavour.

                    In this year's Order of Australia awards, a number of people from my home city of Newcastle were awarded honours, and I'd like to take this opportunity to recognise them here this evening. I will start with Mr Warren Atkins from Merewether, who was granted the

                    </a>
                    in the General Division for his service to mathematics education. Mr Atkins has been helping to spark a love of maths in young Australians for decades both as a member of the Faculty of Education at the University of Canberra and as chairman and founding member of the Australian Mathematics Foundation, which he's involved with to this day. One of Mr Atkins' greatest legacies is helping to set up one of the world's largest mathematics competitions, the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Mathematics_Competition" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    . I know many, many students from Newcastle and across the country who compete in that each and every year.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The next recipient is Kay Fordham, who was given the title of
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                     Member of the Order of Australia
                    </a>
                    for her longstanding contribution to community health. Ms Fordham is a regular face at the Calvary Mater hospital in Newcastle, where she has built a reputation for kindness, compassion and commitment over her two decades plus of service. She has been a member of the Calvary Mater Newcastle auxiliary for over 21 years and the auxiliary's treasurer since 1999. She has also been a member of the hospital's Community Advisory Council, assisting with community and stakeholder engagement, as well as being a member of the hospital's Heritage Committee.

                   <p>
                    Also on the honours list from the medical field is Sandra Berenger, who recently retired from the

                    </a>
                    and was recognised for her groundbreaking achievements in the field of infectious disease control. Ms Berenger, who is now a Member of the Order of Australia, joined the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Newcastle_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
                     Royal Newcastle Hospital
                    </a>
                    in 1971. In the 25 years she was there, she pioneered infection control strategies, most notably working on the strategies to respond to and treat

                    </a>
                    in the 1980s. As a result, she was recruited by the state government to help develop statewide strategies for responding to

                   <p>
                    Another Novocastrian who received a Member of the Order of Australia award is prominent lawyer Mr Richard Anicich, who was recognised for his service to community, business development, and research and law. As well as being a conjoint professor at the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Newcastle" rel="nofollow">
                     University of Newcastle
                    </a>
                    's law faculty, Mr Anicich has contributed to a number of very important institutions in our region, from the Hunter Business Chamber to the Port of Newcastle,

                    </a>
                    , Hunter Primary Care and the Hunter Medical Research Institute—institutions that have really helped shape much of both the current and the future fabric of the Newcastle community.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Another leading light at the University of Newcastle is Laureate Professor Scott Sloan, who is now an Officer of the Order in the General Division of the Order of Australia. This is the second highest recognition available. Professor Sloan is the director of the university's centre of geotechnical and materials modelling and also leads the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Geotechnical Science and Engineering. Most recently Professor Sloan has been working with his colleague Dr Brett Turner on a patented means of using hemp seeds to treat water contaminated by firefighting foam. This could literally change the lives of people living in Williamtown and surrounding areas, who have of course been living with the severe impacts of ongoing contamination, with no specific end in sight.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I'd also like to take this opportunity to recognise Laureate Professor Nicholas Talley, who has been bestowed with the highest honour available, a Companion of the Order in the General Division of the Order of Australia. Professor Talley has had a long and distinguished career at the University of Newcastle and is a global authority on functional gut disorders. With only 35

                     is the opportunity it gives us to recognise those in our community who often go unnoticed. There are thousands of such heroes across our country and dozens in Bennelong. Many remain without the appreciation they deserve. But this year we were able to identify a few more of our most worthy locals. I would like to talk about some of them today.

                     I am proud to bring attention to the work undertaken by Mrs Singer and Dr Kohler, who have both worked towards making Australia a healthier and happier place. The wellbeing of a nation begins at the individual level, and working to ensure that we learn more about those less common conditions and diseases will guarantee that every Australian can achieve their highest possible quality of life. I'm proud to have these two champions, and those who share their devotion to such noble causes, in the Bennelong community.

                     for his significant service to secondary education in New South Wales through administrative and executive roles, and his service to educational standards. His services include his work at the Department of Education as the Director of Public Schools New South Wales, at the Hills School between 2016 and 2017 and also at the New South Wales Board of Studies, where he was a member of the teacher education policy advisory committee.

                     for four years between 1997 and 2001. We all understand the importance of education, which is well and truly the life blood of any nation. It is people like Mark who ensure that the education system in our country continues to provide Australian children and adolescents with a rigorous and rounded education. This ensures that they go on to be engaged members of our society with the knowledge and skills to maintain Australia's position. I'm proud to say that, as a member of the Bennelong community, he has received serious recognition for his lifelong commitment to perhaps the most important area, education. Our community is strengthened by the efforts of those like Mark, who display a commitment to ensuring that young Australians receive an education of the highest standard.

                     It is the selfless devotion to something larger than oneself that greatly enriches our communities but also our nation more broadly. All recipients of these awards deserve recognition and praise for the work they've undertaken. I'm pleased to see these four members of the Bennelong community receive the Order of Australia medal. Congratulations to you all and may your example encourage others in our society to give more to their fellow Australians.
