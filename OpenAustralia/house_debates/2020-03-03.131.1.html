       <p>
        My local economy has been sluggish for the last few years, but, thanks to important and targeted investments in infrastructure in the electorate of Herbert and Townsville, we are definitely starting to see some growth. I want to take this opportunity today to highlight a few of the major projects in my electorate that are helping to achieve this: $200 million for water security for our city and surrounds; $75 million for the port of Townsville expansion project; and hundreds of millions of dollars for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Highway
        </a>
        , in multiple sections, to improve not just safety but also freight efficiency in order to boost business.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of Townsville's biggest concerns prior to our flooding event, only in February last year, was the need for long-term water security. For many years, as a community, we have suffered crippling drought. Fortunately, we have just had a few weeks of solid rain and the makings of a proper wet season, which is a nice change after so many years of dry. And, yes, whilst the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_River" rel="nofollow">
         Ross River
        </a>
        dam is today at 84 per cent capacity, we can't rely on the rain to fall and we can't forget that, for months, the dam level was sitting at around 15 per cent, because of which we had very strict water restrictions. These ongoing restrictions don't just mean that people can't keep their gardens green; they hamper business and they reduce the appeal of Townsville as a city to move to and invest in. We can't forget where we were just over a year ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why we've invested $200 million for stage 2 of the Haughton pipeline to the Burdekin dam, which is so important. Working with other levels of government, we will deliver the new pipeline, giving our economy better access to clean water for our growing population. By completing stage 2 after stage 1, we will be able to achieve cost savings. Throughout the three-year construction phase of the project, around 691 new jobs will be generated and a further 30 full-time ongoing positions will be created. Stage 1 is very close to completion and work will soon begin on the federally-funded stage 2. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister for their commitment to this project. I know it's a big investment, but it's a big investment that's going to give a major, much-needed economic boost to my community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another project that is providing a boost to the city of Townsville is the port of Townsville expansion project. This is a major, long-term plan to cement this important facility's future. Townsville's port is the largest commercial port in northern Australia. When our port is busy, our city is successful. When exports and imports are going in and out, we know jobs are being sustained and business is chugging along nicely. But as the interest and desire to use our port increases, so does the size of the ships which freight companies are using. Unfortunately, right now our port can't cope with the increase in demand and, at just 92 metres, it's one of the narrowest ports in the country. Currently, our port can only accommodate ships which are less than 238 metres in length. Obviously this has a significant impact on the number of ships we are able to welcome into our city. So we have committed to increase that to 300 metres. When this happens, we'll be able to welcome more freight and bigger cruise ships, so the first stage of this project is to widen the channel by dredging it out and installing a new rock wall. We are very close to announcing who the successful tenderers are and just weeks away from the very first rock being laid. Already, this is delivering jobs for locals and work for local companies. We are delivering for Townsville with this project and its $75 million contribution. It's a very welcome and valuable kickstart for the port and their $1.6 billion port expansion project.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thirdly, most of us in this place will have heard of the Bruce Highway—I'd say all of us have. It is a major artery that serves the east of the great state of Queensland, running all the way from Brisbane in the south through Townsville up to Cairns in the north. While this road is an important asset for our community and our economy, sections of it in the north leave a lot to be desired. That's why we have listened and are now investing $12.6 billion in the Bruce Highway over 15 years to bring it up to scratch. The reason for this is not only to cope with the growing number of cars and trucks that need to use our roads and to keep our state moving but also to ensure that as few people as possible lose their lives in avoidable car crashes. Anyone who says goodbye to their families in the morning should have their families returned in the evening. Upgrading our roads to ensure this safety needs to be a priority. The Bruce Highway runs straight through the middle of my electorate and the electorates of many other members in this place, and there are a number of recent investments that are already making a difference to the everyday lives of residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very pleased that in just the past few weeks, a $20 million safety package north of Townsville is nearing completion, with one of our region's riskiest intersections reopening after a five-month closure. We've lengthened the right turning lane at the Bluewater Drive intersection and improved lane marking. We've also completed a new southbound overtaking lane a little further north. These are important works to ensure better safety for all road users in an area that has been notorious for crashes. There have been 14 reported crashes here in the past five years, including two that very sadly resulted in fatalities. This project will not only go a long way to avoid those crashes happening in the future; it has also supported 60 jobs through the design and construction phase.
       </p>
       <p>
        A little closer into town, we are investing $107.65 million in upgrades to the Bruce between Veales Road and Pope Road, including building another bridge over
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_River" rel="nofollow">
         Black River
        </a>
        and reducing the number of dangerous intersections where crashes occur far too often. This stretch caters for an average of 14,000 vehicles a day, many of whom are residents of Townsville's northern beaches, travelling into the city to work each day. Again, it's about improving safety so those who go to work in the morning come home safely at night whilst also supporting the local economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I want to mention stage 5 of the Townsville ring-road. I talk about this project a lot because it's important and has so many benefits. Stage 5 of the ring-road is the last piece of the puzzle for this multistage road, which has been worked on since 2006. It will duplicate the last remaining six-kilometre section, once again improving safety and making more room for more cars and trucks to travel along it and get freight in and out, of and through our city, supporting our local economy. Continued works to upgrade the Bruce Highway in my electorate are delivering excellent results for my community.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are just a few projects that are going on in my patch which we are delivering for Townsville. Of course, there are many other projects in defence, education, health, the environment, agriculture—far too many to mention in a mere 10-minute speech. I am proud to be honouring what we have committed to do in Townsville, but also what we are delivering for the Bruce and around the country. We are investing a record $100 billion over 10 years from 2019-20 through a rolling infrastructure plan to help manage our growing population, meet our national freight challenge and get Australians home sooner and safer. This includes an additional $23 billion of new funding in the 2019-20 budget for projects and initiatives that will benefit every state and territory and provide local job opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge the focus on regional and rural Australia because we know, and I definitely believe, that regional areas, like the great city of Townsville, are fantastic places to live, work and raise a family. In particular, the Building Better Regions Fund has helped our region out so much, through building the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Palm Island
        </a>
        retail precinct, as well as many other things it has done in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        , including Drive It
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NQ" rel="nofollow">
         NQ
        </a>
        . The North Queensland driver education and motor sport precinct is important because it will teach young people how to be safe on the road. It's going to have driver education and a place where they are going to simulate a crash and have users work through it with emergency services. I don't think there is anything more important, when people leave in the morning, that they come home safely at night.
