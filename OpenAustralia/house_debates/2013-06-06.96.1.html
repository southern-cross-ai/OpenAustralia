       <p class="italic">
        Note: The FWC may deal with a dispute by mediation or conciliation, or by making a recommendation or expressing an opinion (see subsection 595(2)). One of the recommendations that the FWC might make is that an application be made under Part 3-2 (which deals with unfair dismissal) in relation to the dispute.
       </p>

        (2) Any conference conducted for the purposes of dealing with the dispute (other than by arbitration) must be conducted in private, despite subsection 592(3).

        Note: For conferences, see section 592.

       <p class="italic">
        (a) the FWC must issue a certificate to that effect; and

        (b) if the FWC considers, taking into account all the materials before it, that arbitration under section 369, or a general protections court application, in relation to the dispute would not have a reasonable prospect of success, the FWC must advise the parties accordingly.

        Note: Sections 726, 728, 729, 730, 731 and 732 prevent multiple applications or complaints of a kind referred to in those sections from being made in relation to the same dispute. A notification can only be made under this section where there is no such other application or complaint in relation to the dispute at the time the notification is made. Generally, once a notification is made no such application or complaint can be made in relation to the dispute (see section 727).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) The FWC may deal with the dispute by arbitration, including by making one or more of the following orders:

        (a) an order for reinstatement of the person;
       </p>

          On this occasion we do agree with the government and the minister, but on nothing else related to this Fair Work Amendment Bill 2013. These amendments have been the subject of discussion. I understand they are broadly supported by industry and were recommendations of the Fair Work Commission. We have no issue with them.

           I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2013 and move government amendment (1) on sheet

           Again I believe this is broadly agreed in the House. The bill currently before the House provides that relevant provisions will commence on proclamation or not later than six months after royal assent. The amendment clarifies that the provisions will commence on 1 January 2014. This will provide certainty to all stakeholders, including employers, employees and the Fair Work Commission, about the operation and commencement of this important jurisdiction.

            Very briefly, I spoke to these amendments during my contribution in the second reading debate. These are simple amendments that would extend and provide a means for enforcing the right that people have under the Fair Work Act to request flexible working arrangements. These amendments would in situations where an employer unreasonably refuses that right allow the employee to take the matter to the Fair Work Commission, where they would be able to balance the needs of the employer, including the operational requirements of the employer, and the legitimate needs of the employee. This is important. It is important that the right to request these arrangements has teeth, otherwise it amounts to little more than a right to have a conversation. That would be the state that the bill would be in if we did not pass these amendments. I think these amendments would have broad support in the community. People are increasingly struggling to balance their work and life arrangements. I commend the amendments to the House.

              Again, very briefly, I addressed these matters in my speech in the second reading debate. These amendments would address some of the issues that have arisen in respect of the operation of the Fair Work Act. In particular, for nurses and people in the public sector where they face powerful employers—workers, for example, in areas like Qantas—it would provide them with some protection against powerful employers tactically using industrial action or tactically dragging out negotiations. It would give the Fair Work Commission greater power to resolve the whole of disputes and ensure that, from the perspective of powerful employers, they could not do these things tactically—for example, by prolonging disputes or by grounding a fleet. I commend the amendments to the House.

              Briefly, I referred to this in my speech in the second reading debate. This bill proposed by the government makes some welcome moves to extend protections to people who have experienced family violence. In particular, I applaud the government for extending the right to request flexible working arrangements. What my amendments would do is strengthen the protections against adverse action for victims of family violence. What this would mean is that someone who is in a position where they have experienced family violence or are looking after someone who has experienced it, who perhaps then makes a request of their employer, or perhaps not, are protected against adverse action from their employer. For example, if someone is not in a position to turn up to work on a particular day because they have been the victim of family violence, then it would be prohibited to take adverse action against them that might otherwise be lawful. This amendment has the support of domestic family violence campaigners. It is something that I hope receives sympathetic attention from the government and the opposition.

               <p>
                As we have seen recently, when the Fair Work Commission assesses the minimum wage it takes into account potential superannuation rises for employees. This amendment would have the effect of saying that would not be taken into account for future increases to the minimum wage. I accept that for wages above the minimum wage it may be appropriate to consider whether to trade off future superannuation increases against wage increases. But for those who are on the minimum wage, when the minimum wage is so low, that trade-off should not be made because they are probably going to retire on the pension and not be reliant on their superannuation in the same way as others. So they need a wage increase now and that should be taken into account by the Fair Work Commission.

                 These amendments relate to workplace bullying and many speakers on this side of the House have alerted members opposite in the government to the ridiculousness of including provisions on workplace bullying in a fair work bill.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is a plethora of state and also federal agencies that can take complaints about workplace bullying. There is a Work Safe Australia in every single state and territory. It is bizarre that the government should have decided that they want to include a whole new subject matter in a bill to amend the Fair Work laws of this country that actually has nothing to do with that. There are provisions already underway with the government's own Safe Work Australia. Why would you introduce a new mechanism about a new subject that is already under discussion for legislative debate with Safe Work Australia into a bill that is designed to look at the Fair Work review? We take very seriously the issue of workplace bullying. We noted with interest the House of Representatives committee's report into the issue, but we are really disappointed that the government did not see fit to deal with the issue in separate legislation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We support the proposals to address workplace bullying, but only if it is clear that the worker has first sought help and impartial advice from an independent regulatory agency and, further, that these provisions are expanded to include the conduct of union officials towards workers and employers. The amendments that I move achieve this objective and I would encourage members on the crossbenches to support them. It is important to recognise that these amendments have already been supported by the government's handpicked lead reviewer of the Fair Work Act who was reported in
                 <i>
                  Workplace Express
                 </i>
                 on 14 May as having said the coalition's proposal that bullying claims go through an independent regulatory agency before being lodged with the Fair Work Commission was a great way to do it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In fact, the minister just moved an amendment that we agreed to that said that the workplace bullying activities of the Fair Work Commission would not start until 1 January because there is absolutely no way that the Fair Work Commission can get together a whole unit to deal with the subject matter that is not really in its purview in the next couple of weeks. So the government acknowledges itself that it cannot get its act together before 1 January and has extended the period by six months. The most sensible thing would be to filter out complaints of bullying made in the workplace through the existing agencies and the existing structures which include state
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OH" rel="nofollow">
                  OH
                 </a>
                 &amp;S law as well as the common law. Then, if there is no resolution, maybe bring it to the Fair Work Commission.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As well as that, it is perfectly obvious to everyone in this place that some of the biggest bullies in the workplace are union bosses. So we are saying that the bill should be amended to include bullying by union bosses of workers and employers in the workplace. Every speaker on this side of the House has brought evidence to the parliament in this debate of exactly that. These are perfectly moderate amendments and I commend them to the House.

                   I agree with the last part of what the member for Farrer was saying. Obviously, coming out of mustering camps and having worked as a labourer on many occasions in the mines, I have difficulty here because what one person may construe as bullying may be another way that people just simply talk to each other in situations of very high tension and very high danger. We are not people to equivocate in the bush and in the mines, I can assure you. So the definition worries me greatly and I have had difficulties with no part of the

                   proposal except in this area. I would agree with the first part of the opposition's amendments but certainly not the second.

                     by leave—I move opposition amendments (1) to (3) of sheet 2 together:
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">
                     (1) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 7), omit the table item.
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">
                     (2) Schedule 4, page 20 (line 1) to page 28 (line 29), omit the Schedule.
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">
                     (3) Schedule 7, item 1, page 34 (lines 14 to 29), omit Part 5.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I will speak briefly about the amendments, but what is more interesting and important in the case of these amendments is the process. The government and the opposition struck an agreement to remove the expanded right-of-entry provisions from the Fair Work Amendment Bill yesterday. That agreement was still in place when we all woke up this morning and, as far as I know, it was in place at lunchtime today. But in a hasty scramble, only an hour before question time, the government informed us that in fact the very amendments that they were about to move, to take the right-of-entry provisions out of this bill, were not going to be moved, and that the bill as originally circulated by the government was going to stand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So the government's own amendments were pulled at the last minute. Why could that be? Who benefits from union right of entry, or should I say expanded right of entry? Unions, of course. What dirty deal must have been done? What insistence was there that more money be allocated to the union coffers in this last few hours before these right-of-entry provisions hit the table to make this minister and this government scramble away from them and give in to the union bosses that hold them to ransom?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We have referred to the Prime Minister's promise of no expanded right of entry. Right-of-entry provisions in this country today are very strong. They are very firm. They allow unions way too much, and we have said that we will draw them back. Only today I heard of an example of a childcare centre in Queensland where the union, United Voice, desperate to sign up new members, barged into the lunch room, looked at the sign-on sheet and said: 'We haven't met these members of staff. Who are they? Where are they? Why can't they come in? Why can't we sign them up to the union?'
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     What we are moving with these amendments is to take out the right-of-entry provisions that the government had agreed with us to do. We are concerned about joy-rides and lunch room invasions; the default provisions in this bill say that the union can choose the lunch room as the default meeting place. Only 13 per cent of Australian workers belong to unions; the other 87 per cent have to have their lunchtime and their quiet time interrupted in this manner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I strongly commend these amendments to the House and I look forward to the support of the crossbenchers.
