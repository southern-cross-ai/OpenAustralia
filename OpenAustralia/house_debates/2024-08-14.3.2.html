       <p class="italic">
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the frequency of severe weather events is the dominant reason home insurance premiums are skyrocketing, fast becoming unaffordable and in turn, fuelling inflation;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) severe weather events are already costing the Australian economy over $38 billion a year and this cost is predicted to rise to at least $73 billion per year by 2050 if climate change continues unmitigated;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) over 12 per cent of households are facing extreme insurance stress, paying more than four weeks of gross income to home insurance premiums, risking underinsurance of their properties;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) every $1 invested in climate adaptation measures can save up to $11 in disaster recovery; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the Government continues to allocate significantly less funding to resilience and adaptation than to disaster response and recovery, with less than ten per cent of Australian homes being climate risk resilient; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) allocate funding to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) the Resilient Building Council to expand the home and business resilience ratings scheme to incentivise home adaptation measures and put downward pressure on insurance; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) expand the Australian sustainable finance taxonomy to include adaptation, to unlock global capital for private sector led resilience;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) include climate resilience and adaptation as a matter of priority in upcoming updates to the National Construction Code and require resilience for all government investments;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) accelerate the development of a national standard for climate adapted planning controls; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) ensure equitable access to insurance by helping lower income households and communities facing home insurance stress and underinsurance in high risk areas.

        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) recognises:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the vital role early childhood education and care (ECEC) educators and teachers play in supporting young children's early learning and development;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) properly valuing and recognising the ECEC profession—including through fair wages—is critical to reversing attrition and growing the workforce;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) paying ECEC workers fairly is a crucial step in charting the course to a truly universal ECEC system; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the Government's historic announcement for a two-year, 15 per cent ECEC worker retention payment for ECEC workers, phased in from December 2024;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) one year on, the Government's cheaper child care reforms are delivering real cost of living relief to household budgets;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's child care inquiry found that out-of-pocket costs dropped 11 per cent following the introduction of the Government's cheaper child care measures; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Government's ECEC worker retention payment will be tied to a commitment from early learning services to limit fee increases to 4.4 per cent, an important condition that will keep downward pressure on fees for Australian families; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) since the election, there are 860 more ECEC services, around 68,000 more children in ECEC, and around 30,000 more ECEC workers; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) between 2018 and 2022, fees under the previous Government increased by 22.8 per cent compared to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">

        (1) acknowledges that:

        (i) means making quality services accessible to all children and families;
       </p>

        (a) ECEC sets children up for life;

        (c) children who attend quality early childhood education are twice as likely to reach their developmental targets once at school;

        (d) children experiencing disadvantage and vulnerability—who are likely to benefit most from ECEC services—are less likely to attend ECEC;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the cost of ECEC in Australia is amongst the highest in OECD countries, representing a major cost of living pressure for many households; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) ECEC enables mothers, in particular, to maintain a connection to the labour force when children are very young and allows for increasing hours of work as children grow; and

       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Government to commit to, and provide, a pathway and timeline towards universal early education and care.
