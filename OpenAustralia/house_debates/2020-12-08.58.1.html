        My question is to the Prime Minister. This year, 685 aged-care residents have, tragically, died from COVID. We've heard reports of ants crawling out of wounds and residents being left, literally, without food or water. It is a national tragedy. Does the Prime Minister accept responsibility, and the finding of the aged care royal commission, that this government had no plan for COVID and aged care?

         I will ask the Minister for Health to add further to my answer. I addressed this issue earlier in relation to the government's plans that were place to support our preparedness and our response to the aged-care impacts of COVID-19. As we look around the world today and see the COVID-19 pandemic impact once again on countries in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Hemisphere
         </a>
         , particularly across Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States, we reflect back on when the second wave of COVID-19 in Victoria hit that state so hard. We saw the number of cases that arose from the outbreak in the community mirrored in what happened in aged care. And, as the cases in the community receded, we also saw the number of cases in aged-care facilities recede. The two things were completely connected. That's why we worked closely together with the Victorian government through the Aged Care Response Centre, which we led, to ensure that we were providing the support necessary in those facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some eight per cent of facilities in this country were affected by COVID-19 during the course of this pandemic. Fifty-six per cent of facilities were impacted in the United Kingdom, a factor of seven times what occurred in this country. The individual impacts on those we've lost as a result of COVID-19 are a terrible and awful tragedy. All Australians accept that, and the Australian government accepts that and the responsibilities that we have in relation to the aged-care system in providing that support. We have never walked away from that. We have worked each and every day to ensure we have sought to mitigate and to lessen the impact of COVID-19 in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         When we look around the world, I know Australians see what has happened in this country and what has happened overseas, and they've seen in this country that our response not only was world-class but also set the standard around the world. I know that Australians are grateful, as I am, that in this country the impacts have been far less than in so many other places around the world, but that does not diminish the impact, the injury and the hurt to every family that has been affected by this crisis. Of course it doesn't.
        </p>
        <p>
         All governments have had a role to play in providing that support. Where there have been failures and deficiencies, our government has owned those. We've dealt with those and we've learned from those, as have state governments and territory governments around the country. In so doing, we have continued to manage one of the most effective responses to COVID-19 anywhere in the world today. And we will continue that, because the COVID-19 pandemic is not over. There's still a long way to go. Whether it's on the health road or on the economic road, Australians have seen our government respond, and respond effectively, saving lives and saving livelihoods.
