        , you are a proud member of the ADF family. To be this man, you must be incredibly brave; you must push the envelope right to the edge. But you would never be foolhardy. To be this man, you have to trust your training and your mates. To be this man, you must realise that some may fall. To be this man, you have to know that it could be you. These men are out the front.

       <p>
        As the member for Fadden so eloquently put it yesterday, others literally walk in his footsteps. That is what these guys do. They lead the way and clear a path so that others are safe. These men are highly trained. They are tough and highly professional. They possess skills and reflexes few of us will ever witness. He died among friends, protecting them. He died with his mates saying he was brave and strong.

Scott Smith died too young and he will be missed. Lest we forget.

        <p>
         I join with my colleague the member for Herbert in speaking with great sadness on the death of Corporal Scott James Smith. On Sunday, 21 October 2012, 24-year-old Corporal Scott James Smith was killed on his second tour of Afghanistan by an improvised explosive device. Australia has lost an exceptional soldier who possessed all of the qualities of a great leader. I wish to express my deepest sympathies to his partner, Liv; his parents Katrina Paterson and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Murray Smith
         </a>
         ; his sister, Roxanne; his friends; and the fellow soldiers who knew and served alongside him.
        </p>
        <p>
         Corporal Smith was a member of the Special Operations Task Group and was from the Special Operations Engineer Regiment based at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holsworthy_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
          Holsworthy Barracks
         </a>
         in Sydney,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . Corporal Smith joined the Army in February 2006 and moved quickly up the ranks, proving to be a leader. He is described by his unit as a genuine, honest and dedicated member who was probably one of the best junior non-commissioned officers the unit has seen. Corporal Smith's family describe him as a man who lived life to its fullest, had a great sense of humour and loved being outdoors. He pursued many sports, such as cricket and waterskiing. He was the lovable character that held the family together.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to having been deployed twice to Afghanistan in 2010 and 2012, Corporal Smith also served in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
          Solomon Islands
         </a>
         in 2006. Corporal Smith was awarded various honours, including the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan_Campaign_Medal" rel="nofollow">
          Afghanistan Campaign Medal
         </a>
         , the Army Combat Badge and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Medal" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Medal
         </a>
         . The loss of Corporal Smith is indeed very sad. On
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
          Remembrance Day
         </a>
         , in just a few weeks time, we will be honouring those who have given their lives for our country. It is a great tragedy that Corporal Smith's name will be amongst those.
        </p>
        <p>
         Corporal Smith's death is again a terrible reminder to all Australians that our soldiers in Afghanistan work in an extremely dangerous and life-threatening environment on a daily basis. Their dedication, courage and sacrifice can never be taken for granted and we honour them for it. I offer again my sincerest condolences to his family, who will feel Corporal Smith's loss for their lifetime. We honour him. We honour them for their sacrifice. Lest we forget.

         <p>
          I thank the previous speaker for her contribution. I rise to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow ministers and all other members who have been involved in this expression of condolences to the family, friends and comrades of Corporal Scott James Smith.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our thoughts and deep sympathy go out to his loved ones and to his family by choice, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          . In particular, we send our condolences to those with whom he served alongside in Army Special Operations Engineer Regiment. Corporal Smith was a young man, just 24 years old. But, as we know, he was an experienced soldier, having spent seven years with the Army. He had already undertaken deployments to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
           Solomon Islands
          </a>
          and had had one prior tour of Afghanistan. Among our elite forces he has been acknowledged as 'one of the best junior non-commissioned officers that the unit has seen'. That high praise from his peers and superiors, along with the many decorations he received during his too-brief career, show that he was a strong, smart and very committed professional soldier.
         </p>
         <p>
          Behind the indescribable sadness for his family and friends, there should be pride for his service to our nation. I offer my deepest sympathies to his parents, Katrina and Murray, and to his sister, Roxanne. I also offer my thanks for raising a wonderful son. Scott was a young man who found his calling wearing this country's uniform. Thank you for the support you provided him to undertake a career of service. I would also like to express my sincere sadness and condolences to Corporal Smith's partner, Liv. I cannot imagine the pain she is going through, but she needs to know that the thoughts of our nation are with her.
         </p>
         <p>
          There was another family that knew Corporal Smith very well, his second family, as his family dubbed them: his comrades. Those he served alongside of are mourning the loss of one of their own, a man they described as 'genuine, honest and dedicated'. What goes unsaid, though, is that he was brave, capable and committed to serving his country. His death is being deeply felt across his unit and the Army more widely. Corporal Smith was tragically killed when an improvised explosive device detonated during a clearance operation in Afghanistan's Helmand region early this month. He is the 39th Australian killed in the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. He is the 19th member of the Special Operations Task Group to make the ultimate sacrifice.
         </p>
         <p>
          We acknowledge the burden borne by our special operations forces in Afghanistan. Their role in this conflict is intense and extremely dangerous. We know that the operation Corporal Smith was undertaking was critically important. We know that, through his operation, an estimated 100 improvised explosive devices and a bomb-making factory were destroyed. We know this was an important operation.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IED" rel="nofollow">
           IED
          </a>
          s are a terrible, indiscriminate weapon, deployed without thought about who they kill or maim. The destruction of this bomb-making factory will save many, many more lives, including the lives of Australian and allied forces, Afghan civilians, women and children who can be caught in IED blasts.
         </p>
         <p>
          Australia's mission in Afghanistan is ongoing and our commitment remains strong. That strength comes in no small part from the dedication, drive and professionalism of our forces on the ground. Our men and women in Afghanistan know that the work they are doing. What they are fighting for is a young nation to stand strong and resist terrorist forces intent on plying their evil trade. As the Minister for Defence pointed out, we will not be in Afghanistan forever. Work towards transitioning Afghan-led security in Uruzgan is on track. We have also been a nation that sees these things through and gets the job done. We are a nation that honours its fallen by finishing what we have started. All Australians owe our forces who serve in Afghanistan, who have served in Afghanistan, those who continue to fight and, sadly, those who have been lost in the conflict an incredible debt of gratitude.
         </p>
         <p>
          Corporal Scott James Smith will have his name added to the Roll of Honour on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
           Australian War Memorial
          </a>
          . His sacrifice will be remembered forever, alongside 102,000 others who have given their all in Australia's name. Lest we forget.

           I rise to add my voice to this motion of condolence on the unfortunate and untimely death of Corporal Scott James Smith. I note that it was at age 24, certainly so young for a life to be taken. I cannot remember what I was doing at age 24 but I certainly was not serving my country in the way that Corporal Scott James Smith did and I think none of us in this place probably were. It is something that I do not think you are prepared for when you go into parliament for the first time and I note some of my colleagues opposite are relatively new, like me, and I do not think they prepare us for the sadness that we feel in having to listen to yet another condolence motion being moved on the death overseas of another one of our finest. But I think I certainly speak for all here when I say that his life and certainly his death would not have been in vain.
          </p>
          <p>
           As has been mentioned, Corporal Scott James Smith is our 39th Australian soldier killed in Afghanistan. A corporal with the special forces combat engineers, he grew up in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barossa_Valley" rel="nofollow">
            Barossa Valley
           </a>
           but was more recently based in Holsworthy. By the age of 24, at his death, he had already been honoured with many awards including the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Active_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">

          </p>
          <p>
           There is really nothing that can speak greater about the life of Corporal Scott James Smith than the statement that was given by his family which I was extremely touched by when I read it. I think it duly honours them to have it read in to the
           <i>
            Hansard
           </i>
           <i>
            .
           </i>
           His family said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Scott was a tremendous soldier. It is openly acknowledged that he was well respected within his workplace and by those who knew him.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           We knew the Army was Scott’s second family, his home away from home. Scott truly believed his actions made a difference; he was a truly dedicated soldier, who also knew how to relax in his time away from work.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Scott lived life to the fullest. He was born in the Barossa Valley and was water skiing as soon as he could stand—it was one of his great loves.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Scott attended school in the local area and used his school holidays to learn to barefoot water ski.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Liv, Scott's German princess, met him when she was an exchange student in Australia. After that, the pair could be found in all sorts of mischief together.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Scott loved being outdoors and keeping fit throughout his lifetime and pursued many sports—from long distance running, to cricket and any sort of competition he could be involved in.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Scott had a great sense of humour and was very much into practical jokes. He could also be very relaxed when not at work—becoming renowned for his cheeky smile and kind words. But mostly Scott will always be renowned for being the loveable character that held the family together.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Scott had a lot of time for those who had time for him, and his generosity in all things was often spoken about. One of the things you could rely on Scott for was calling whenever he was able and was thinking of you, at midday, midnight, or anywhere in between.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Scott had a larrikin charm that endeared him to all those around him, and these qualities ensure he will always be held in the hearts of those who knew him.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Our family is united in grief as we try to come to terms with our loss.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           We thank everyone for their heartfelt wishes and messages of condolences, but ask that our privacy be respected during this difficult time.

           I have discussions with people in the community and colleagues here about the mission in Afghanistan and now and then I come across incidents which remind us of why we are there and why and how Australians are making a difference. I think of all the issues that we can single out the treatment of women and girls in Afghanistan by both the community and by the legal system is one that is a stand-out in terms of us making a difference. Also, it highlights the difference that we need to keep making. I would like to quote Cynthia Dill, a human rights lawyer who wrote recently in the

           I think it is fair to say that these were the things that Corporal Scott James Smith would have known that he and his unit were fighting for. I think these ideals are ones which he as a soldier, one of the best of the best, would have held very closely to his heart. Although I did not know him, I admire him. I pay my deepest respects to his family on his loss and wish to record my deepest sorrow at the passing of someone who Australians can hold in the highest esteem, whose name will be added to that honour roll at the War Memorial. Lest we forget.

            There is a tremendous debt of gratitude and responsibility felt by parliamentarians for our service men and women who are actively engaged in operations overseas. Today, we mourn for and pay tribute to Corporal Scott James Smith from the

            Corporal Smith had been in the Army for six years and was on his second deployment to Afghanistan after transferring from the Darwin based Number 1 Combat Engineer Regiment to the

             Solomon Islands
            </a>
            in 2006. Corporal Smith was the 39th Australian soldier to fall in Afghanistan, the seventh this year and, as we heard from the veteran's affairs minister, the 19th Special Forces member, the sixth elite soldier and the 15th digger overall to be killed by an improvised explosive device. As the veterans' affairs minister said,

             IED
            </a>
            s are indiscriminate weapons of war. They are intended to maim and kill and do destructive damage absolutely indiscriminately.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the time of his death, Corporal Smith was engaged in a mission against an insurgent network specialising in IED attacks in the north Helmand province. Defence said more than 100
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEDs" rel="nofollow">
             IEDs
            </a>
            in other places were destroyed in the fatal mission, dealing a blow to the network. Comrades described Corporal Smith as:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            … a genuine, honest and dedicated member who was probably one of the best junior non-commissioned officers that the unit has seen.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Special Operations Task Group Commanding Officer, who cannot be named for operational reasons, told Corporal Smith's comrades that the 24-year-old

            … exemplified what it took to be a special forces combat engineer.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            "Scott’s sense of obligation, his sense of loyalty and his sense of purpose made him the epitome of the calling of combat engineer," said Lieutenant Colonel I.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            "The type of physical and moral courage required of our special forces combat engineers is what we all hope for ourselves, but in the case of this man he displayed it every time he deployed on missions and tasks."
           </p>
           <p>
            The officer also made a solemn vow to Corporal Smith's family and partner that he would not be forgotten. He said, 'It is our task to tell others of the type of man that Scott was and the wonderful things he did.' The motto at Corporal Smith's old school, Nuriootpa High in South Australia's

During Corporal Smith's service in the Australian Army he was deployed on the following operations: Operation ANODE in the Solomon Islands from November 2006 to December 2006; Operation SLIPPER in Afghanistan from February 2010 to July 2010; Operation NORWICH in Australia from November 2011; and Operation SLIPPER, again, in Afghanistan from July 2012 until his untimely demise.
           </p>
           <p>
            His passing is a grim reminder of the sacrifices our military personnel make on our behalf in the war for freedom. Our soldiers are directly protecting our freedom to move unencumbered by the threat of terrorist activity, as well as establishing new peaceful communities in strife torn Afghanistan. As we heard the member for Greenway say, they have made such an inroad, particularly on behalf of women and on behalf of educational opportunities for those people in Afghanistan. Even though their hard work is of great importance, the price Corporal Smith has paid is a heavy one for his family, friends and, indeed, for our nation to bear.
           </p>
           <p>
            Corporal Smith is survived by his partner, Liv, his parents Katrina Paterson and

            , and his sister Roxanne. We are forever indebted to him for his sense of duty, his bravery and his sacrifice. He has, as his alma mater's motto suggests, passed the test of adversity and now belongs to the heavens. May he rest in peace. Lest we forget.

             I rise to offer my respects to Corporal Scott James Smith, who has paid the ultimate price fighting for Australia, fighting for all Australians. Corporal Smith died while on operations in Afghanistan on 21 October 2012 in northern Helmand province. Despite his comparatively young age, he was on his second deployment to Afghanistan, having served as part of Operation SLIPPER from February 2010 to July 2010 and again from July 2012. Corporal Smith was a member of the Special Operations Task Group and was from the Special Operations Engineer Regiment based at

             in Sydney.
            </p>
            <p>
             Corporal Smith was born in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barossa_Valley" rel="nofollow">
              Barossa Valley
             </a>
             in 1988. He joined the Army in February 2006 and upon completion of his initial employment training was posted to the First Combat Engineer Regiment in Darwin. In 2008, Corporal Smith was posted to the then
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_Response_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
              Incident Response Regiment
             </a>
             as a search operator. Corporal Smith is described as an exceptional soldier, who possessed all the qualities and charisma of a great junior leader. He is described by his unit as a genuine, honest and dedicated member, who was probably one of the best junior non-commissioned officers that the unit has seen. Corporal Smith sadly, like so many sappers, paid a heavy price for his work in Afghanistan. Our sappers are on the front line. They find and dismantle improvised explosive devices and in doing so, they protect the special forces soldiers who follow them and walk in their footsteps.
            </p>
            <p>
             They are brave men, men of extreme courage, who often deal with sophisticated explosives at night, under fire and in a hurry. Corporal Smith was killed in a battle that destroyed an insurgent network specialising in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IED" rel="nofollow">
              IED

             attacks. The Special Operations Task Group subsequently removed 100

              IEDs

             from the battlefield. Australians and Afghanis are safer because of Corporal Smith's courage and bravery. On behalf of the Ryan electorate, I extend my sincere condolences to Corporal Smith's family, friends and colleagues. Lest we forget.

             <p>
              I commend the previous speakers on their contributions to this condolence motion for Corporal Scott James Smith. Many speakers have had a particular connection, either through the training bases or by having a large military presence in their electorate. I would like to make a contribution as well, not having known Corporal Scott James Smith but knowing that hopefully, in some way, these eternal words by the representatives of the people of Australia will also recognise the eternal sacrifice by someone way too young to make the ultimate sacrifice—not that there is any age that would be appropriate for the 38 soldiers who had already died in Afghanistan and now for the 39th. All too often I have been on my feet in this chamber recognising the passing of a great Australian in this sacrifice in Afghanistan.
             </p>
             <p>
              As a corporal with the special forces combat engineers, given the way soldiers talk, Corporal Smith would have known how closely and how often he and his comrades would have been in harm's way. I am sure he would not have known that growing up in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barossa_Valley" rel="nofollow">
               Barossa Valley
              </a>
              . We have heard from other speakers about his passion for waterskiing. As someone who grew up in rural Australia, I know how much waterskiing is such a great joy and I think of him now doing that—and I am sure his family will—and the laughter and the jokes from his time as a bit of a scallywag, from what we have heard from previous speakers, the media coverage and the reports from his family. I think of him laughing and having a great time waterskiing and joking with his friends and his family, and particularly with his partner, Liv. I am sure they are the memories that will be of great comfort to his family in the years ahead. As I said, this is one small contribution in terms of having my words, and the thoughts of the people who reside in the electorate of Moreton, recognise his sacrifice.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do not have a significant connection with the Army; I am more connected with the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
               RAAF
              </a>
              . As with many of the people in the parliament, my other interaction with the military is through the parliamentary placement program, where we get to see the incredible professionalism of our ADF personnel for a week, normally in Australia or around the place. It was from that that I was tempted to see what contribution I could make to the military, and I joined the RAAF Reserve as a legal officer. The other day, as part of a training day, rather than going to Amberley where we normally go—it is nice and safe for RAAF personnel—we went to Enoggera, an Army base, and it was one of the hottest days already this summer. It was in the mid-to high 30s at this training base, for a room full of lawyers. When we broke for lunch, it gave me an insight into the character of our special forces and combat engineers when I saw soldiers running around, on a Saturday, in the middle of the day. You could not get more genteel than RAAF lawyers, specialist reserve people, and here we were seeing the hardcore soldiering at Enoggera. Then, if you take another step higher to someone like Corporal Smith, in terms of the special forces combat engineers, to be back in Afghanistan on his second tour, at such a young age, just puts me in awe of the honours that he has been deservedly awarded.

              The family of Corporal Scott James Smith will read these words, hopefully, in the years to come and take some consolation from the incredible awe and respect that this

              , on behalf of all Australians, has for the sacrifice that they have had to endure. I know that none of this will make it particularly easy for them, but I hope that in the years to come they will recognise how appreciative we are of the great professionalism of our soldiers.

              We heard from the member for Greenway about the great changes that have occurred in Afghanistan, a particularly troubled nation. Before this condolence motion, we were acknowledging the 10th anniversary of the Bali bombing. Sadly, the two are horribly linked, because we know that we have to take the initiative in this modern world where terrorism is easily exported. That, sadly, means putting Australians in harm's way. We have to take the initiative in places like Afghanistan. We have to engage in our region, in places like those parts of Pakistan where terrorism is rife. Nearly 40,000 people have been killed there—6,000 or 7,000 of those in the military and police. We have to be constantly on the alert and that means we have to make that horrible decision to send Australians overseas. On behalf of all Australians, I thank the family of Corporal Scott James Smith for allowing him to go over there and I acknowledge his great sacrifice. Lest we forget.

               With the same sadness that other members have expressed, I consider it an honour to be able to stand in this place to pass on my condolences to the family of Corporal Scott James Smith. As we have heard, Scott James Smith was doing important work—important work for the people of Afghanistan and important work for his colleagues in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Army
               </a>
               . He was doing things that needed to be done. As we know, sometimes, in order to get important things done and to protect freedoms and liberties—and to make Afghanistan a better place—somebody has to step up and somebody has to put their life on the line. On this occasion, the person who put his life on the line for a good cause was Corporal Scott James Smith. We thank him for that and I also thank his partner, Liv; his parents, Katrina Paterson and

              <p>
               There have been 39 Australian deaths in Afghanistan and just yesterday we spoke about Sapper Penpraze and his tragic death at the Holsworthy range. We acknowledge that, with service in the military, the reality is that one's life will always be on the line, whether in training or in operations. Corporal Smith was a combat engineer within the Special Operations Task Group. The task of clearing and searching compounds for improvised explosive devices falls to such soldiers. Corporal Smith was just 24 years old but already a veteran, given his many years of service to our nation. He was an exceptional soldier with the highest qualities and he possessed charisma—clearly he was a very good junior

               </a>
               and a young man who no doubt had great potential to rise through the ranks. Corporal Smith was clearly respected by his unit and by his colleagues and he was loved by his family
              </p>
              <p>
               This is a reminder to us all that the decisions we make in this place to send our soldiers, sailors and airmen around the world can sometimes have the gravest of consequences. It is encouraging, though, that we have, overwhelmingly, seen great signs of progress in Afghanistan. The country is a better place for the presence of our soldiers and for the sacrifices they have made. We have more work to do in the next couple of years and we hope that there will be no more deaths from within our forces, but we must nevertheless face the reality that there may be. That happens when we put our people in harm's way.
              </p>
              <p>
               I thank his family for the sacrifice he made and offer my sympathy for the gap in their lives that they will no doubt feel for years to come.

               I express my condolences and my gratitude on behalf of the people of Cowan for the sacrifice that this brave young soldier made and wish his family all the best in the very difficult times ahead.

                I rise to join a chorus of colleagues in paying our deep respects following the death of Corporal Scott James Smith who tragically died in Afghanistan on 21 October 2012. Corporal Smith was only 24 years of age. He was a member of the Special Operations Engineer Regiment based at Holsworthy and he was involved in clearing an area where he was subsequently killed by an improvised explosive device, an

                 IED
                </a>
                . He is, tragically, the 39th Australian soldier to die in Afghanistan—more than 240 have been wounded—and he is the 19th fatality from the Special Operations Task Group.
               </p>
               <p>
                Corporal Smith was a leader among brave men and women. Despite his youthful age he had been in the Army for nearly seven years and during that time he had previously served in Afghanistan as well as in the

               <p>
                Special Operations Commander Australia, Major-General 'Gus' Gilmore spoke of Corporal Smith’s lasting legacy. He said:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Scott was universally respected by everyone in the Special Operations Engineer Regiment, and well liked by all who crossed paths with this fine young man … His fellow combat engineers will honour his sacrifice through continuing the tough and dangerous work they undertake in Afghanistan, with courage and distinction.
               </p>
               <p>
                I have been to Afghanistan where I travelled with colleagues from both sides of this House. We saw firsthand the bravery and the professionalism of more than 1,500 Australian men and women who were acting in Afghanistan to make Australia a safer place.
               </p>
               <p>
                Our contribution in Afghanistan is part of the war on terrorism. Let us not forget that more than 100 Australians have been killed in terrorist attacks abroad, be it in Bali, be in in 9-11, or other bombings throughout the world. Australians have not been immune from the pain and suffering of victims of terrorism. But by being in Afghanistan as part of a multinational force with more than 40 countries we are doing our part to make the world a safer place. What is more, we are giving opportunity to men, to women and to children who would never have known freedom, or safety, or security as they do today.
               </p>
               <p>
                There are problems still in Afghanistan—nobody seeks to diminish the size of the task ahead. But with a 300,000-strong

                , with a girls school that Australian taxpayers have helped fund that we went to visit as it was being built and with other aid programs that we are doing on the ground, we are making a difference in Afghanistan and Corporal Scott James Smith did not give his life in vain.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is important to understand that Corporal Smith was not just a fine soldier—he was a fine young man, a partner to Liv, a son to Katrina and Murray, and a sister to Roxanne. In a statement from the family of Corporal Scott James Smith, they say:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Scott was a tremendous soldier. It is openly acknowledged that he was well respected within his workplace and by those who knew him.
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                We knew the Army was Scott's second family, his home away from home. Scott truly believed his actions made a difference; he was a truly dedicated soldier, who also knew how to relax in his time away from work.

                …   …   …
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Scott attended school in the local area and used his school holidays to learn to barefoot water ski.

               <p class="italic">
                …   …   …
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Scott loved being outdoors and keeping fit throughout his lifetime and pursued many sports—from long distance running, to cricket and any sort of competition he could be involved in.
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Scott had a great sense of humour and was very much into practical jokes.
               </p>
               <p>
                The statement also said:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Liv, Scott's German princess, met him when she was an exchange student in Australia. After that, the pair could be found in all sorts of mischief together.
               </p>
               <p>
                That is the human side of this condolence motion. That is the tragedy of the loss of life of Corporal Scott James Smith. When we in this House all go back to our offices and to our families at home, Liv and Katrina and Murray and Roxanne will not have their loved one with them. My heart and my prayers go out to the Smith family. I say to you that your son was braver than us here—he volunteered; he was not conscripted. He volunteered to serve in the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
                 Australian Army
                </a>
                . He put his life at risk not for one day, not for two days but for weeks, months and in fact years as he served his country. In this place we must always seek to uphold the values that make Australia great, because what Corporal Scott James Smith has done is go abroad and make the ultimate sacrifice to see Afghanistan become a better place and also see Australia be a safer place too.
               </p>
               <p>
                Our thoughts and our prayers go to the Smith family, and I join with my colleagues on both sides of this House in saying to them that their son, their partner, their brother, Corporal Scott James Smith, was a hero to all. Lest we forget.

                 . On the evening of 21 October 2012, Corporal Scott Smith was involved in an operation against a network of insurgents in Uruzgan province in central Afghanistan. While he was searching a compound as part of a team of Afghan and Australian special forces, an improvised explosive devise detonated, taking his life.

                 and in 2010 he completed his first tour of duty in Afghanistan. Corporal Scott Smith was widely respected in his unit, and we have heard from many in the past few days about his wonderful warmth of personality and sense of humour. He received nine honours during his six years of service—an extraordinary achievement for such a young man. He has been described as one of the best junior non-commissioned officers his unit had known and also as an honest, genuine and dedicated man.

                 These numbers have significance in and of themselves, as each loss is keenly felt by the families and friends of those who have died and by all Australians. That is very, very true—it is felt deeply by all Australians. Our concern for those men and women currently serving is ever present. But there is more than a matter of numbers or an individual sprint record to reflect on. Corporal Scott Smith was the loving partner of Liv, the much loved son of Katrina and Murray and the brother of Roxanne. He was a mate and he was a young man dedicated to his mission. By all accounts he exemplified the attributes that make is also proud of the men and women who join our defence forces.

                 I read that Corporal Scott Smith's family said that the Army was his second family, and this is the case for so many Australian service men and women—it truly is a second family for them. It is important that the public at large understand the dedication and commitment of our young men and women and of the service they give to this country.

                 Our mission in Afghanistan is critical. We are helping young girls to break free of totalitarianism and oppression. For the first time they are able to get an education. Early this month the world was shocked when Malala, a 15-year-old Pakistani girl, was shot for speaking out against the Taliban and their oppression of women—in particular, women are trying to get an education. If we ever need reminding of why we are trying to suppress the reach of the Taliban and al-Qaeda, the attempt to kill young Malala is why. Our mission there is to restore peace and, hopefully, a level of prosperity to a people who have been victims of extreme oppression, extreme hardship, war and difficulty for many, many decades. Australia's role in world events and particularly in peacekeeping is recognised as critical, and our success in gaining a seat at the

                 As we contemplate this loss, our thoughts are on the tragic death of the brave young Australian. We salute his bravery and we mourn his loss. He will be remembered. On the evening of Sunday, 21 October 2012 a man braved incredible danger in the service of Australia, in the service of the world community and he died tragically. I join with my colleagues in paying tribute to Corporal Scott Smith and sending my condolences, my thoughts and my prayers and my deepest sympathies, and those of the people of Canberra, to his family, friends and mates. Lest we forget.

                  It is with much sadness that I rise, for the second time in two days, to express my condolences over the loss of a sapper stationed at Holsworthy. The role of a sapper is a brave one. The sapper advances even beyond commandos on the frontline, to provide for their safe passage, locating and dismantling improvised explosive devices, mines and bombs, and does this under fire, often at night. It takes a very special soldier to perform this role, and sadly we have lost too many in recent times.

                  was a sapper serving with the Special Operations Task Group and was from the Special Operations Engineer Regiment. It says much of his character that Sapper Smith lost his life while conducting a partnered clearance operation against an insurgent network in Uruzgan. In other words, he was doing his bit to improve conditions and increase the safety of his fellow soldiers. Following this operation, more than 100

                  s were dismantled and removed from the battlefield. We have seen the devastation that just a single IED can cause. His fellow soldiers are safer because of the work he did in Afghanistan. It is impossible to know how many soldiers are safe tonight because of his courage, his bravery, his skill and his professionalism, but we know it is many.

                  . Sapper Smith enlisted in the Army in 2006. He demonstrated a strong aptitude and made his way into the ranks of the elite 1st Combat Engineer Regiment after initial employment training. Scott's family said of his aptitude for military life:

                  We knew the Army was Scott's second family, his home away from home. Scott truly believed his actions made a difference; he was a truly dedicated soldier ...

                  But he was much more than that. Scott was someone who loved life and someone who lived life to its fullest. Corporal Smith is survived by his partner, Liv, his parents, Katrina Paterson and

                  , and sister, Roxanne. At this time I think we should pause to think of the absolute evil that Corporal Smith was fighting against. In the history of mankind we have seen many evil ideologies but we have seen very few as evil as the Taliban. In the last week we have had a reminder when the Taliban shot in the head a 14-year-old schoolgirl, Malala, simply because she was speaking about the right for girls to have education. This is the evil that Corporal Smith was fighting against. This is that he gave his life to fight. Lest we forget.
