        <p>
         I thank the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">
          McPherson
         </a>
         for her question, which raises some complex procedural considerations. I will attempt to place these considerations before the House.
        </p>
        <p>
         The House has no precedent of its own to follow if a second reading amendment should be agreed to. However, the specific terms of the amendment indicate that the bill is unacceptable in its current form, and that a different policy approach is preferable. If the House agrees to this amendment, the effect would be similar to that if the second reading of the bill were negatived. No further progress would be possible on the bill as transmitted from the Senate.
        </p>
        <p>
         A substitute bill could be introduced that implements the policy approach preferred in the amendment by the member for Lindsay. This would only be possible immediately following the granting of leave or the suspension of standing orders. A notice of motion to this effect could be lodged contingent on the amendment moved by the member for Lindsay being agreed to, but, to be effective for the next sitting, this would need to be lodged before the House rises today.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the second reading amendment is negatived, the House will have made a clear decision in relation to the policy approach proposed by the amendment. It would not therefore be possible to move amendments during consideration in detail that would seek to implement that policy approach.

          Mr Speaker, I wish to clarify my position. I understand that there is no interest in having a suspension of standing orders. To reassure members, I have distributed a copy of the bill that will be introduced in place of the current bill in order for the proceedings to continue and a vote to be taken on my combined amendment.

           Mr Speaker, on a note of clarification on what the member for Lindsay has said: my understanding is that, if the amendments are not successful, we will proceed with the bill before the House. If the amendments are successful, the member for Lindsay then can bring to the House a new bill. Is that correct?

                   <p>
                    Mr Speaker, given the importance of this debate and the fact that it is a conscience vote, I think it is very important that people are clear about the procedures. The worst of all possible worlds would be, of course, that someone exercised a vote in error because they were confused about the procedures. I understand very clearly that the effect of your ruling, with which I very strongly concur, is that if the second reading amendment moved by the member for Lindsay is passed by the House, that negatives the second reading and the bill before the House is at an end. If the second reading amendment moved by the member for Lindsay is not carried by the House, we will then proceed with the second reading of the bill and on to the third reading, which would include the consideration of the amendment proposed by Mr Laming, the member for Bowman.
                   </p>

                    be very clear, though—and I think this is a matter of government business scheduling as much as it is a matter of anything else: is it being suggested that, should the member for Lindsay’s second reading amendment be carried, the House would then immediately move to consideration of the private member’s bill that the member for Lindsay has said she will make available to members? It is a very important matter. As you would know, Mr Speaker, we are here at 10 to four today and I have not seen that private member’s bill yet. I suspect very few members of this House have seen that private member’s bill. It is a matter that people would want to give the same consideration to that they have given to the bill before this House. It would be inappropriate, even by way of suspension of standing orders, which may or may not attract a conscience vote, to force the House to immediately deal with it unless it were very clear that that was going to be the course of action proposed and people could prepare themselves for that—particularly when I have heard no suggestion that the House will not rise at its normal time tomorrow, so the time available for the consideration of any subsequent private member’s bill by the member for Lindsay is dreadfully short indeed.

                     It is my understanding that the member for Lindsay’s alternative bill is about to be distributed. It is also my understanding that the bill is precisely in the terms of the amendments that she flagged yesterday. There will be as much opportunity to consider the member for Lindsay’s bill as there has been to consider other important matters that have come before the House as part of this debate.

                       Further to my point of order, I think the matter could be assisted. I know we are dealing with something that is a contingency, but I think it is very important that people understand what could happen in the event of that contingency. The opposition has been very cooperative with the government. Both the Leader of the House and I have privately discussed the importance of not gagging something that attracts a conscience vote, because that would be contrary to what I think would be everybody’s broad approach that, insofar as is humanly possible, people ought to get their opportunity to have a say on a matter that attracts a conscience vote. I anticipate that there would not be anybody who would suggest that, if the current bill before the House attracts a conscience vote, a bill by the member for Lindsay will not attract a conscience vote. I think everybody would concede that it too would attract a conscience vote. I am seeking an assurance from the Leader of the House that it is not his intention to gag the member for Lindsay’s bill through tomorrow.

                             Mr Speaker, I believe that too much is being made of difficulties. The fact is that what the member for Lindsay has moved in this House, as I understand, was canvassed with the clerks beforehand. It is perfectly in order under the standing orders. There are clear procedures, which you have already outlined to the House, and any suggestion that the member for Lindsay should in any way be obliged or requested to change her procedures I think is quite wrong. Apart from anything else, this amendment has been moved and seconded and the seconder is not in this House.

                                    That is the member for Lindsay’s clarification, but that is not what the member for Mackellar was seeking. It is clear cut, Mr Speaker, and she deserves a clear-cut answer. It is possible for a person to remove from the chamber any amendment that they have moved in their name. They can withdraw that amendment if they want to. That is point 1. Point 2 is this: it is possible to amend the legislation in the way in which has been suggested by a foreshadowed bill in consideration in detail, which answers the second part of the member for Mackellar’s question. That is possible too. That course of action is open. If the member for Lindsay does not want to take that course of action, that is fine. But the member for Mackellar is entitled to a straight answer on it.

                                          Mr Speaker, I want to ask a question to clarify one point in your ruling. I understood you to be saying that, should the second reading amendment be negatived, it would therefore preclude the member for Lindsay from moving in consideration in detail any amendments that are broadly of the same thrust. Is that personal to her or does that preclude other members from doing so, on your ruling? Is this something that you believe applies generally—that is, if a second reading amendment is negatived, it precludes any member from moving in consideration in detail an amendment that reflects broadly similar sentiments?

                                            I am sorry, Mr Speaker, I did not understand your response. If another member, whether with respect to this bill or another bill, decides to move in consideration in detail an amendment that arguably reflects a sentiment that was contained in a second reading amendment that has been negatived, would that member be precluded from doing so? Would they be out of order in doing so?

It must remain where it is.

                                                486 bill. As we have been discussing, the bill before the House is a private members’ bill which has come from the Senate. A conscience vote has been extended by all political parties. Consequently, in participating in this debate, every member of the House has identical status to every other member of the House. It is not one of those government business propositions where the minister is in a special position vis-a-vis other members of the House. In light of the fact that every member of the House is in the same position as every other member of the House in dealing with this proposition, my question to you is about the appropriateness of a member of the government executive, most particularly the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for
