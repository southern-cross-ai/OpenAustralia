        I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for his cooperation in this matter. To explain the reasons for moving this motion, it is intended that tomorrow we will start debate at 12 o'clock. That will enable more discussion to be held. There will not be votes during that period, but given that there are a number of budget related bills which must be carried, either this week or in the first week we are back in June, this is preferable to us sitting late at night in terms of the convenience of the House. I have said to the Manager of Opposition Business that it is up to him which legislation we debate, but at this stage it is intended that we will debate the
