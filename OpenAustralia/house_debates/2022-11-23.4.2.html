        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) acknowledges that Australian households are worried about increasing pressures from the cost-of-living crisis brought about by recent interest rate rises and continued inflation;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) consecutive interest rate rises since May 2022 have placed mortgage stresses on many Australian households and more rises are expected;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) Australians are hurting, but in its budget, the Government failed to outline a plan to take pressure off interest rates; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) Australians cannot wait another seven months for the Government's second budget to come up with a plan to deal with cost-of-living pressures that have become very real and painful for so many;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) recognises that despite telling Australians their power bills are going up by more than 50 per cent, their mortgage payments will continue to rise, the cost of groceries will remain high, and inflation will continue to surge, the Government still has no plan to tackle this cost-of-living crisis; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) calls on the Government to focus on the issues that matter to Australians and to deliver a real and comprehensive plan to ease inflation and cost-of-living pressures.

        (1) notes that:

        (a) for nearly a decade, the former Government's oversight of the

         National Broadband Network
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        ) had been a masterclass in technological incompetence and financial mismanagement, causing Australia to trail other developed countries on broadband quality and speeds;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Government is delivering what Australians voted for and will expand full fibre access to 1.5 million premises by 2025 with a $2.4 billion equity investment over four years in the 2022-23 budget;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) this will:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) deliver a faster and more reliable NBN to more families, communities, and businesses and allow more Australians to take advantage of an increasingly digital global economy; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) give Australians who now rely on copper connections the choice of having full fibre connections to their premises if they want a faster NBN service than their current copper wire can deliver; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges economic analysis commissioned by NBN Co that estimates the additional fibre-to-the-premises connections will deliver an additional $20 billion uplift in gross domestic product by 2030 through connecting communities and businesses to faster and more reliable broadband services.

        (1) calls on the Government to provide for agricultural security in Australia particularly given recent dramatic increases in the cost of production as a result of dislocations in imports and Australia continuing to be a net importer of fruit and vegetables:

        ) can be life-changing for Australians with disability;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        (a) improve outcomes for participants;

       <p class="italic">
        (3) notes the measures the Government has already taken to get the NDIS back on track, including:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) installing new leadership at the National Disability Insurance Agency (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">

         Administrative Appeals Tribunal

       <p class="italic">
        (c) reducing the number of people with disability trapped in hospitals despite being medically fit for discharge; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) funding 380 new positions in the NDIA for better and faster planning decisions for people with disability and their families, carers, disability service providers and workers;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) calls on Members of the House to support the work ahead to make the NDIS the world-leading scheme it was designed to be, through:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the root and branch review of the NDIS to improve its effectiveness, so that future generations receive the benefits of the scheme;

       <p class="italic">
        (b) planning for a workforce that can support the projected increase in NDIS participants;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) establishing a senior executive role within the NDIA to bolster its stewardship of the sector; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) reducing waste and fraud so money intended for participants is not syphoned off or squandered; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) further notes the benefits to the Australian community and our economy when we invest in people with disability and break down barriers to their participation in social and economic life.
