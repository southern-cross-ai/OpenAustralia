       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the RACQ has found that 1,398 kilometres of the national highway between Gympie and Cairns is undivided and much of this section is rated just two stars out of five for safety;

       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Government's funding cut to upgrades of the national highway from 80 per cent to 50 per cent of project costs will:

       <p class="italic">
        (i) delay or cease future upgrades to the national highway;

        (ii) put motorists' lives at risk;

       <p class="italic">
        (a) restore the former Government's 80 per cent funding share of projects to upgrade the national highway to expedite projects that will make it safer, increase capacity, and make it less prone to flooding; and
