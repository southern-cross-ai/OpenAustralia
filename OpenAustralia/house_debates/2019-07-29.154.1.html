       </p>
       <p>
        There is a crisis in home care for older Australians. It is caused by government's neglect or incompetence or indifference. Mary in my electorate was a victim of the current government's failure. Mary suffered Parkinson's disease for about 20 years. In early 2017 she had a fall and was hospitalised. In order for Mary to be able to go home, she needed assistance at home. She was approved for a level 4 home care package and put on the waiting list. What should have been a solution became a nightmare for Mary and her family. There are four levels of home care, with level 1 being the lightest and level 4 being for people in the greatest need. Mary needed real care at home. There was a lack of service availability for level 4 packages around her area, so she couldn't get one straightaway. One of her daughters gave up full-time work to become Mary's carer. They waited and waited and waited. Her two daughters pleaded and argued with anyone who would listen. Finally, Mary was granted an interim level 2 package in early 2019, two years after she was put on the waiting list for level 4. It took two years for Mary to receive an interim level 2 package. In recent months she has been granted an interim level 3 package, there is but still no sign of a level 4, which was promised over two years ago. My office made representations to My Aged Care about service availability for Mary and I was told there was a nine to12 month waiting period for level 4 packages, which stems from a lack of funding. That's bad enough, but the reality for Mary was much worse—more than twice that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mary passed away last week, still without receiving her level 4 package. Her story is not unique, far from it. Mary is one of nearly 130,000 older Australians on the waiting list. Older Australians without any home care package total over 75,000. Those with an interim package, like Mary, waiting for the appropriate level of care, are just over 53,000 people. In the latest available figures, in the first quarter of this year in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        the Morrison government released 757 home care packages. In an environment of growing need and unacceptable delays, that is 20 per cent less than in the same quarter last year. In Western Sydney there are still 1,591 people waiting for their home care packages and 243 people, real people with real need, waiting for level 4. If you look at the potential demand in my electorate of Parramatta alone, there are 12,600 people over the age of 70. That demand will only grow as our community gets older and really needs to be able to age at home. The aged care system that we have, the aged care reforms, were meant to give older Australians the choice to age at home, something incredibly important for so many of my diverse communities who, culturally, see their parents going into aged care facilities. The need to keep their parents at home is absolutely central.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once again, in spite of an ageing population and growing crisis, aged care is locked out of the cabinet. There have now been four different ministers responsible for aged care since the Liberals were elected. In January the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        released the median wait time for home care packages. It has blown out in the last year by more than two months. As that list grows longer, we hear fresh stories every day of older Australians waiting for care. Since 2017 the wait list for home care packages has grown from 88,000 to more than 129,000 older Australians. During that period of time when Mary was on the waiting list it grew from 88,000 to 129,000. One can assume she was never going to get to front of the queue on that basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Older Australians are waiting for level 3 and 4 packages in great numbers. In fact, the majority of people waiting for packages are waiting for level 3 and 4; they are in great need. Many of them have been waiting for more than two years for their approved packages. Older Australians are entering residential aged care or even emergency departments instead of receiving their approved home care package. Again, imagine Mary's circumstances if her daughter hadn't been able to give up full-time work and care for her? Mary would have been in an aged care facility or an emergency department.
       </p>
       <p>
        I condemn the government for failing to stop the waiting lists growing. I condemn the government for not acting as they should and solving what is a national crisis. I call on the government to immediately fix the home care packages waiting list and properly address this growing crisis.

           It's a great pleasure to speak in support for older Australians, senior Australians, at any time in this House, and I'm sure every member of this House agrees that it's always a very significant topic to address. I rise to comment on the motion and the issues raised by the member for Parramatta and, like others, I draw on personal experience. I'm of a generation where I can recall as a child seeing my late grandmother, Kathleen McVeigh, remain in her own home right up until her passing, almost 30 years ago. She remained there with the great assistance of my aunty, Betty Peters, who lived not far down the road. The fact is that her remaining in her own home up until her passing was a significant part of the enjoyment of her latter years and that of the rest of the family.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm at the age where I look, as so many do, towards the future residential situation for my own parents and for my mother-in-law. These are important issues for all members in this House to consider. We all have personal experience. In my case, Toowoomba, my home city, being the biggest inland private sector city in this country, represents a centre that is quite popular for those of advancing years—retirees—either locals or others from across northern inland
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           and southern inland Queensland, so this is a very important topic.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm pleased the Morrison government is so focused on investments in home care that aim to reduce the time taken for people to receive the support that they are assessed for. There's a lot of work being done. We need to look at the record. The national prioritisation list, as part of the February 2017 reforms, reflected the true extent of the work that we as a government needed to focus upon. New home care packages increased from 60,308 in 2012-13 under Labor to 124,032 packages in 2018-19, with up to 157,154 predicted by 2022-23. That represents an increase of 161 per cent. That is certainly in line with the government's 2019-20 budget, which will deliver an additional 10,000 care packages to be released across all levels. That represents an investment of just over $282 million, part of a $7 billion funding program over the next five years which I will touch on in just a few moments. Those packages announced in February 2015 do certainly recognise the increasing demand for home care. Packages will be released until 30 June 2020, in line with the budget.
          </p>
          <p>
           Home care packages are supporting senior Australians to remain in their own home, but they do not replace the primary care that Australians receive as part of the broader health system in particular and that remains part of the government's broader focus. It's interesting that those opposite provided no additional funding in their costings for home care packages during the election campaign and no additional funding for aged-care quality workforce or residential aged-care support either.
          </p>
          <p>
           In contrast, our record is proof of a focus on all of those essential elements. I mentioned the $7 billion over the next five years, more home care places and developing a skilled workforce. Improving safety and quality in both home care and residential care is so very important. That's important to my city, as I mentioned, and it's important to regional Australia, where I'm from. I'm so very proud that our government is focused upon just that. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Royal Commission
           </a>
           into Aged Care Quality and Safety, the January 2019 Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission announcement, and other efforts to look at aged-care quality standards and, of course, aged-care rights are further evidence of the government's focus on appropriate aged care in home and certainly in residential care as well.

           <p>
            I welcome the opportunity to support this motion on aged care because this government must be held to account for its handling of the issue of home care packages and aged care in general. As this motion outlines, the coalition government have let 129,000 older Australians languish whilst waiting for the approved level of home care package. This crisis is getting worse. It seems the government has no idea what it means to watch an elderly parent wait in vain for assistance at home. It has no idea what it means for a family to struggle to provide that care, juggling work, juggling rosters and jugging care for their children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Families are taking risks, ultimately, because sometimes it just doesn't work out the way you want it to. And then you worry desperately because you can't get home on time, because an elderly loved one is home all alone just for that bit too long, because they didn't get a shower, because they missed their midday medications or because they didn't eat their lunch. You worry that the post-it notes you put out to remind them to take their pills, turn off the gas or to put the heating on might have fallen away, or been pulled down or missed.
           </p>
           <p>
            New government figures show that almost 30,000 older Australians died or were forced into an aged-care home last year while waiting for their home care packages. I read a particularly harrowing account published in

            It's not just home care that is failing. The royal commission and the sudden evacuation of the Earle Haven Retirement Village on the

             Gold Coast

            highlight the inadequacies of some residential aged-care facilities. In the case of Earle Haven, 70 elderly, frail people, in some cases with dementia, were left in the lurch when the nursing home that they live in and pay fees for, and that taxpayers contribute towards, was shutdown without any notice. There are many questions to be raised about the Earle Haven Retirement Village closure. Why were medical records and medical equipment removed? Why was it so badly managed that police had to step in and relocate the patients?

            reported that the global owner of aged-care contractor HelpStreet Villages, which was running the Earle Haven Retirement Village for owner Peoplecare, had been banned from managing companies by Australia's corporations watchdog because of unpaid debts. As Senator Watt has pointed out in the other chamber, Earle Haven has been repeatedly sanctioned by the government's own aged-care regulators for failing to meet safety and care standards for its residents. I think you really do have to wonder what it has got to take before some sort of serious action is taken.
           </p>
           <p>
            How does a system from which some make a healthy profit from billions in taxpayer subsidies often show no real responsibility or accountability for care of our elderly? As a nurse and as the shadow minister for aged care, I am committed to holding the government to account for this. I want to finish on a positive, though. If there was any silver lining to the Earle Haven closure, it was the behaviour of the staff. Most of them have lost their jobs, but they turned up to care for the residents when they were being evacuated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next Wednesday is Aged Care Employees Day. I want to say thank you to everyone working in aged care. Being in the caring industry makes you special people. You do one of the most important jobs in the world. Your experience with people at the most vulnerable time of their lives means that you are trusted, you are dedicated, you are hard-working and you are loved. You are relied on by so many for so much. I came to this job via your pathway, from the caring industry and union movement, and I'm so glad and proud that I did. The royal commission into aged care and subsequent media attention has been tough for you. I know that. We've seen too much blame placed on aged care staff for what are systemic, long-term issues, mainly caused by funding cuts, poor management, lack of transparency and accountability and a lack of willingness by the Liberal government to tackle real reform.

            nurses and their unions have been screaming out for reform and resources, a call that has been completely ignored by the Liberals. I know what funding cuts mean. I know what it's like to be a carer or nurse and not to be able to deliver the care you want because there aren't the resources allowing you to do your job, because there is limited access to training and skills, and because the workloads are impossible. Thank you for everything, for hanging in there and speaking up. I hope the government listens to your experiences and your calls for funding, reform and staffing.

             Our elderly citizens are among society's most vulnerable populations. They depend on others for care. Yet this government continues to leave too many older Australians waiting in vain. More than 129,000 seniors are now without an approved home care package. This includes more than 96,000 older Australians waiting with high needs, many with dementia. It's a crisis that shows no signs of being contained by this coalition government. In December last year I spoke in this place about the dismal job that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government had done in reducing waiting lists for home care packages. Since that time even more Australians are now on a waiting list. The numbers are increasing, when they should actually be going down. It's part of a broader trend since 2017 that's seen the waiting list for home care packages blow out from 88,000 to more than 129,000 older Australians waiting for packages. That's too many waiting for what should be their right in modern-day Australia—the right to an adequate care package after a life time of hard work and service.
            </p>
            <p>
             These really have been lost years for too many Australians waiting for care at home. As the list grows longer, fresh stories emerge daily of older Australians struggling because of this government's neglect. Bad government translates into worse outcomes for our vulnerable older Australians, their families and their carers. Some older Australians have been waiting for more than two years for their approved package. Over 75,000 older Australians on the waiting list have no home care package at all. Recently I took a call from a member of our community that was 92 years old and had been waiting two years to get some form of aged care package from this government. It's simply not good enough. The majority of older Australians are waiting for level 3 and 4 packages. They have high care needs. Older Australians are entering residential aged care or even emergency departments instead of receiving their approved home care packages.
            </p>
            <p>
             How did it get to this, that some of our most vulnerable Australians are being treated in this way by the Australian government? Government is about priorities. We saw a couple of weeks ago what this government's priorities are when the entrepreneur

             , one of Australia's wealthiest Australians, uncovered that he's receiving half a million dollars each year in cash refunds from this government, simply for owning shares in Australian companies. That is his cash refunds from dividend imputation. He is getting half a million dollars worth. That's one individual, yet this government has 129,000 Australians waiting for aged care packages.

             Reforms to aged care were meant to give older Australians the choice to age at home. But the latest figures confirm that the Liberals' policy chaos has failed older Australians.

             has again been locked out as a cabinet position since the federal election. It's had four different ministers since the Liberals were first elected in 2013. There's been no consistency in this portfolio from this government in terms of ministerial representation, but also no consistency of approach when it comes to policy.
            </p>
            <p>
             The crisis in home aged care is unacceptable. Labor condemn this government for failing to stop the waiting list for aged-care packages growing. We call on the government to immediately fix the home care packages waiting list and properly address this escalating crisis. The coalition needs to act to find solutions, to pass legislation and to implement a plan to continue driving long-term reform. When we have some of the wealthiest Australians receiving half a million dollars in cash payments from the government for owning shares and we have 129,000 elderly Australians on a waiting list for home care packages, something is wrong in this country. What is wrong in this country is that we have a coalition government that does not care about the needs of elderly people in terms of providing home aged-care packages so that they can age with dignity and get the support and respect they deserve. The coalition needs to act. It needs to find solutions, pass legislation and implement a plan to continue driving long-term reform and to reduce the aged-care waiting list. Older Australians can't afford any more lost years and any more lost opportunities waiting for their aged-care packages at home.

              waiting for home care and the estimated 2,846 people who care for them. In my electorate of Dobell, on the

               New South Wales Central Coast
              </a>
              , and across Australia, the home care waiting list continues to climb. I have witnessed firsthand the impact of this government's failure to older Australians and those who care for them. In my community, over the last three quarters, this crisis has continued to grow. Of particular concern are those people how have been assessed and approved and who are waiting with no package and little or no support. Many have been told they can expect to wait a year or more before an appropriate service may become available. Most are waiting for level 3 or level 4 packages. These are people with high-care needs, many living with dementia. Some are offered a lower level home care package as a stopgap. Many are waiting without assistance.
             </p>
             <p>
              In my community on the Central Coast of New South Wales, as at 30 September 2018, the number of people waiting for a home care package who had been given no assistance was 1,178. By December last year, the total number of people waiting for home care of any description on the Central Coast had increased to 1,286. By March this year, the number had climbed to 1,423. As I mentioned, in my community some people have waited over two years for an approved home care package. Sadly, they're not unique or alone as this crisis deepens across the country, demonstrating the failure of the Liberal government to properly recognise or respond to the crisis. People are entering residential care while waiting for their approved level of home care package. People are ending up in emergency departments while waiting for their approved level of home care package. And, sadly, people are dying while waiting for their home care package.
             </p>
             <p>
              Labor has been calling for urgent action to reduce the waitlist for home care packages since data was first released, yet the government has failed to properly respond. This government sat on the January to March quarter data for over three months and only released the figures after the election. Reforms to aged care were meant to give older Australians support to stay at home and to live with dignity, but these figures confirm the Liberals are failing older Australians. Based on the most recent data, more than 129,000 older Australians are currently waiting for their approved home care package.
             </p>
             <p>
              I want to turn to carers. What the government hasn't recognised or acknowledged is that, for every elderly Australian waiting for a home care package, there's least one, but usually two or more, carers under immense pressure. That means, when the impact on primary carers, partners, family members and friends is considered, an estimated 250,000 Australians are caught up in this crisis. Ara Creswell,

              </a>
              of Carers Australia, who I met with again today to discuss the crisis, said that long waiting times for home care packages which provide an adequate level of support can seriously affect the capacity of older people to cope at home in both the short and longer term. While they are waiting:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              … their level of health is likely to decline and their need for support increase, making it difficult to live at home unless they have family and friend carers who can provide the level of care they need. Working carers may have to give up their jobs, while partner carers may also be ageing and not able to provide the level of care needed, or can only do so at the risk of compromising their own health and wellbeing.
             </p>
             <p>
              …   …   …
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              It needs to be remembered that 36 per cent of all carers are over the age of 65 and most are caring for a partner. Their ability to keep on providing high levels of care will frequently depend on additional support from the aged care system.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lorraine from Gorokan in my electorate in New South Wales is one of the 129,000 older Australians waiting for a home care package. Her husband, Tom, is 73 and is one of the estimated 250,000 Australians caring for a loved one without proper support. Lorraine was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2017. She needs a wheelchair outside and uses a walking frame at home. Lorraine applied for and was approved for a home care level 3 package this month and has been told she may have to wait a year for the service to become available. She has organised some help in the meantime with household chores, but her husband, Tom, has, out of necessity, become her primary carer. Fortunately, right now his health is good. Lorraine says:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              He is my primary carer, doing all the cooking, shopping and gardening and I do worry about the stress. I don't want to see my husband get worn out.
             </p>
             <p>
              As Carers Australia rightly points out, aged care is a very complex space, and, while many things are being addressed, carers keep getting pushed to the bottom of the heap. This Liberal government has abandoned thousands of elderly Australians, their partners, family and friends. I speak from my firsthand experience as a carer helping to look after my late father, who lived with young-onset dementia. The government must act urgently to fix the home care crisis.
