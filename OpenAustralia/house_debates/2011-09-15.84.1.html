         I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question. The government has been determined to ensure that we have a full democratic process around the clean energy legislation. After 35 parliamentary reviews, after the Shergold report, after the Garnaut report and after the green and white papers on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS" rel="nofollow">
          CPRS
         </a>
         , it is time now to act. On Tuesday we introduced the legislation into this House. Yesterday we commenced the second reading debate in this House. Also on Tuesday we set up a joint parliamentary committee that will allow scrutiny from outside of the parliament on the 19 critical bills before the parliament. Government and crossbench members in both the House of Representatives and the Senate have already been nominated to participate on that committee. As yet, not a single opposition member has been nominated to participate in that process. I hope that by the end of the day they take advantage and participate in that process.

            I was asked about what support there has been and what views there have been about the debate. There had been some issues about whether we had enough time to debate this legislation so this morning, after putting an appropriate motion on the

            </i>
            ,we had carried in the parliament a motion that we would sit next Tuesday between 9 am and 2 pm, without divisions, to allow an extra five hours of debate because we are determined to make sure that everyone can participate in this debate. We have also said that we would be prepared to sit at other times next week because again we want to make sure, as my learned colleague the member for Hunter has asked about, that all members can participate. Of course there have been some questions about the speakers list and who has a right to speak or not, but I am pleased indeed that, in spite of the fact—

I am responsible for facilitating all members' rights in this House, a responsibility I take very seriously, whether they be members of the government, members of the crossbench or members of the opposition. There has been support for the action that we have taken. The Leader of the Opposition was asked whether the member for Wentworth was going to be speaking in the debate today and he said: 'Well, that's a matter for Malcolm; this debate will go over the next fortnight or so'—
