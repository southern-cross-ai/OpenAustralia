       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, this year's budget locked in $30 billion of cuts to schools. That is the equivalent of sacking one in seven teachers at Narre Warren North Primary School in the electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        . Given the Prime Minister's own green paper contemplates completely vacating the field of the Federation funding schools, aren't these cuts just another part of the Prime Minister's plan to make parents with kids at Narre Warren North Primary School pay a new school tax?

        <p>
         It is terribly sad for the opposition that they have been reduced to this level where they have to make up questions and assertions rather than deal with the issues. But the question does give me the opportunity to range widely over the subject of school funding and trust, which is extremely important. This government went to the election with a promise to match funding, dollar for dollar, for the new school funding model. We delivered it 100 per cent. In fact, we restored the $1.2 billion of cuts visited by the Leader of the Opposition on the school education system in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. We delivered that, and we will continue to increase funding in the next four years by eight per cent, eight per cent, six per cent and four per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member's question might have some resonance if only the opposition leader had committed to the apparent $30 billion in extra spending beyond the forward estimates.

           But even today, at his doorstop in the Mural Hall, he was asked several times by journalists whether they would restore these so-called funding cuts. He said, 'In terms of what we want to do, we'll unveil our policies.' 'But will Labor bring them back to life?' 'Let us be very clear: we would take a policy to the next election.' How fantastic! That is what oppositions usually do. We had about 108, if I remember rightly, at the last federal election. But that is hardly the cast-iron guarantee that the unions and the schools sector are looking for.

           . There has been a preview in

           and, from what it is looking like, tonight's episode of
           <i>
            The Killing Season
           </i>
           will look more like the red wedding episode from the

                 Julia Gillard
                </a>
