         Court of Disputed Returns
        </a>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) Notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders or any other resolution, referral of a Member to the Court of Disputed Returns may be moved without notice by a Minister or the Manager of Opposition Business.
       </p>
       <p>
        I won't delay the House at great length debating the citizenship register. It's been well and truly debated in the public domain, and today is not the day for debates about the referral of members of the House to the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns. But I will explain the elements of the motion to the House. The first clause of the motion establishes a register of citizenship, asks members to make statements in relation to their citizenship and requires them to do so once the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests has finalised the terms of a form which I understand has been written and circulated. The Privileges Committee will make a decision about that directly after this debate, and then the form will be circulated to all members to be returned to the clerks by 9 am tomorrow morning, so 9 am Tuesday, 5 December.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have been working through the terms of this register and this motion with the opposition and with the crossbenches, and we settled on nine o'clock on Tuesday morning because we made, I think, the fair assumption that most members by now will have checked out their citizenship and any steps they might have taken to renounce citizenship of another country, and we want to give the Speaker and the clerks ample time to be able to get that information up onto the internet to enable people who are interested to examine the evidence as presented by members and then to give us ample time in the House of Representatives this week to refer any members to the High Court if that is in fact necessary. In the case of at least three members, the government believes it will be necessary, but that's not a debate we have to make today.
       </p>
       <p>
        So members will be asked to make a declaration concerning their citizenship. They'll be asked to provide evidence of their parents', grandparents' and spouses', if applicable, citizenship. If it's found in any of those cases that there is a reason why they may be a dual citizen of another country, what steps did they take to renounce that citizenship and when was it so renounced?
       </p>
       <p>
        The second aspect of the motion places it under the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests, which, of course, is where the Register of Interests is held by the House, and gives the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interest the power over this particular aspect of the standing orders. The next aspect shows when the citizenship register will be published on the website. We haven't put a hard time on the publication on the website, out of courtesy, really, to the clerks and to the Speaker's office, where we felt that potentially it would be difficult to meet a particular deadline, but I think we're all fully understanding and cognisant of the need to get that information out into the public domain as quickly as possible. I'm sure there'll be no delays in trying to do that, but we didn't put a hard time for that to happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Element 5 is that, of course, false statements or deliberate omissions will be regarded as a contempt of the parliament and the necessary sanctions would be applied after a reference to the Privileges Committee of anyone who does give false information in the register and that the referrals to the Court of Disputed Returns would not only be able to be made by a minister but also by the Manager of Opposition Business in the House. Clearly, that is a departure from the current standing orders, but the view has been taken that, of course, a majority is required to refer any member to the Court of Disputed Returns in any event. We have been working with the opposition on the register of citizenship because I think it's in all of our interests to ensure that everybody sitting in the House is legitimately elected, and, of course, the government has taken its steps. We had a by-election in New England which we spectacularly won on the weekend. We had a spectacular win on Saturday, a record-breaking win—the biggest win for a government in a by-election, by the way, since 1911.
       </p>
       <p>
        A government member: The swing was bigger than the Labor vote.
       </p>
       <p>
        The swing was bigger than the Labor vote, as the Deputy Leader of the House points out. And we will have a by-election in Bennelong, as you referred to this morning, Mr Speaker. We have done the right thing on this side of the House, but I think it's in everyone's interests to be sure that everyone sitting in the parliament is legitimately sitting here, and that's why we move this motion. I look forward to the support of the opposition and the crossbenches.

        </small>
        <p>
         I mentioned publicly over the weekend that I was planning to move a number of amendments to this motion when it was moved. I hate to disappoint, but the amendments I was going to move are now already part of the motion, so Labor will simply be supporting the motion that's before us. The change to having the deadline moved to 9 am Tuesday is of critical importance. It guarantees that there is time for the register to be up and for it to be public, and it is early enough for members to engage in proper scrutiny of whatever the register brings forward. I urge all members on both sides, once the form is made available, to get the information in as quickly as possible and not to use the deadline as the start time, for the very simple reason that that would take a lot of pressure off the clerks and off the Speaker's office in the work that they have to do. And it guarantees that we will get closer to a 24-hour turnaround for the information to be able to become public, which is in everybody's interests.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also note that the concept which there's been much discussion about over the last 24 hours, about whether only a minister would be able to move a motion of referral, has now been rectified, and it now can also be moved by the Manager of Opposition Business—a job held by me. I say to the crossbench: if there are referrals of any kind that they would seek, I am certainly very happy to have those conversations if the crossbench wish something like that to take place.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thank the government for the way this has worked its way through. There have been times in the public debate when it probably hasn't been ideal. I was bemused, after the Leader of the Opposition had called for this and the government then came forward and said they'd do it, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs said Labor had finally relented to the government's position. It is true: we were dragged to agreeing with our own position, and we thank the government for those glorious comments which were made. But the opposition, given that we have now got to a sensible position, will be supporting this motion.
