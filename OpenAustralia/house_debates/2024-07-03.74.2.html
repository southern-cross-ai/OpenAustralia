        My question is to the Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness. Despite all the federal government's talk about doubling housing and homelessness funding, funding for Tasmania will, in fact, decline this year under the National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness from $38.1 million to $37.4 million. This is the biggest proportional decline of any state. Minister, I'm sure you understand the dire housing situation in Tasmania as well as I do. How on earth could you let this happen?

         I thank the member for Clark for his question. I understand where he is coming from with his question and his concern for the people of Tasmania who are struggling with housing challenges. Indeed, I share his concern in terms of what is happening in Tasmania with housing. But I want to reassure the member for Clark that the inference of his question is actually not true. No state or territory is going backwards in funding under the new agreement. None. That is not including all the additional money as well, which is part of our $32 billion Homes for Australia Plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         I say to the member, I have been working very closely with the Tasmanian state government. Since our election, we've provided more than $145 million to Tasmania for homelessness services and to build more homes. Under Housing Australia, with the housing accord and the Housing Australia Future Fund, Tasmania, as one of the smaller jurisdictions, will be getting at least 1,200 homes on top of that funding. So Tasmania will be getting our fair share, let me assure you of that, as will other states and territories.
        </p>
        <p>
         I had the opportunity, just a few weeks ago, to go and announce 15 new social homes with the Tasmanian minister, Felix Ellis, in Berriedale, in the member's electorate. Standing next to me, the Tasmanian Liberal minister, Felix Ellis, said, 'The federal government has provided significant new funds.' These homes are, of course, being supported by the $50 million we provided to the Tasmanian government through the social housing—

          Speaker, a point of order. Regarding the National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness, the minister is attempting to mislead the parliament.

           No, member for Clark. You are unable, under the standing orders and practice, to even suggest that. To assist the House, with a long line of precedents, I will ask the member for Clark to withdraw.

            <p>
             Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the member for Clark. I will reiterate: no state or territory will be receiving any less under the new housing agreement. Let me be very clear about that. I'm happy to have a meeting with the member for Clark to go through the figures and clear this up with him. I'm also happy to advise the member for Clark that 25,000 Tasmanians will be benefiting from an increase in Commonwealth rent assistance—the first back-to-back increase in more than 30 years. That will be supporting many Tasmanians. Since the last election, the Albanese Labor government has also supported 1,500 Tasmanians into homeownership through our expanded and improved Home Guarantee Scheme and, of course, we want to do more with Help to Buy, the shared equity scheme. I'll continue to work with the Tasmanian government to deliver more homes for Tasmanians who need them.
