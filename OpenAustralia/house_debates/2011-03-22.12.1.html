         I thank the member for Braddon for a very important question because the government, unlike the opposition, believes that climate change is real and that we do need to transform our economy. But this is a very big reform for our economy, a very big structural reform. One of the reasons Australia has had 20 years of continuous growth is past governments and members of this House have signed up to fundamental market based reforms, which have given us a strength and resilience that have served us well and that have given us 20 continuous years of growth. This is a reform that we must embark on to ensure that we have another 20 years of continuous growth and do not fall behind the rest of the world. That is why economists like Nichols Stern and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Garnaut" rel="nofollow">
          Ross Garnaut
         </a>
         are telling us that there is a fundamental problem here that must be fixed. The problem is that the largest polluters just continue to pump pollution into the atmosphere, and that has cost. It has cost to the environment, it has cost to the community and it has cost to our economy. That is why we must have a market based approach to deal with it. We need to give the largest polluters the incentive to reduce carbon pollution and that is what we have to do. That is why we describe this as a fundamental market based reform. Of course, we are not alone in this view. That is what the Treasury believes we must do. That is what the

          Productivity Commission

               Whilst not calling upon the Deputy Prime Minister to withdraw, it is starting to be really hard to see how the point in his response is directly relevant to the question, as it was asked. The Treasurer has the call and he will be directly relevant to the question.

                The point I was making was that those opposite do not believe in the power of markets any more. This is a fundamental point. Nor do they apparently believe in the science of climate change. That is a powerful, destructive combination. Not believing in climate change, not believing in global warming and not believing in markets makes them almost the equivalent to the central planners of Russia, decades ago.

                  They are in denial all of the time about the basic facts, not believing in the basic science and not believing in the basic economics. About 18 months ago some of them did believe in the power of markets, the power of markets to deal with carbon pollution. This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say to David Uren and Lenore Taylor, in 2010:
