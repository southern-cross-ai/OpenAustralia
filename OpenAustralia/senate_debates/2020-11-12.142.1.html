        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. In Senate estimates this week, it was revealed that the ABC managing director received half-a-dozen emails as well as phone calls from staff of government ministers questioning the airing of the

           Perhaps in this question, the minister could take those answers on notice. Senators Stoker and Henderson asked a series of questions at Senate estimates designed to undermine the legitimacy of the

            That is quite a remarkable allegation coming from Senator Watt, seeking to cast judgement on questions asked by senators, seeking to cast judgement on or impugn the motives for questions asked at estimates by other senators. Of all the people to seek to judge when it comes to Senate estimates behaviour! We're not going to take any lectures from Senator Watt. We're not going to take lectures about standards of conduct in Senate estimates from Senator Watt.

               Senator Watt, you know the question had a lot more than that in it. And, I might say, I will ask people to carefully reflect on the wording of questions when imputing motives to other senators asking questions, as opposed to attributing them to a potential effect of asking questions. I didn't call you up on that, but I think that came perilously close to imputing a motive to the actions of another senator in performing their duties as a senator. Now, there was a lot in that question, and the minister is more than directly relevant in responding.

                I would be very surprised if Senator Watt, who asks a lot of Senate estimates questions—and good on him for doing so—has never had a conversation with his leader or his leader's office or other shadow ministers or other colleagues or people outside of this building. Senators come and ask questions in Senate estimates—
