        The National Business Names Registration System forms part of the Council of Australian Governments' Seamless National Economy reform agenda. The National Business Name Registration Legislative Package, which establishes a National Business Names Registration System, received

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Application Bill needs to be enacted before the first proclamation of the Business Names Registration Act, which is due to take place in late March 2012, to allow the transitional provisions to take effect before the commencement of the National Business Names Registration System.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of the Bill is to provide for a more equitable and robust cost recovery regime for the supervision of securities exchange markets, by enabling the charging of market participants in addition to market operators in relation to the performance by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        IC of its market supervision function.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The current fees regulations, Corporations (Fees) Regulations 2001 (which are made under the Corporations (Fees) Act 2001), reflect an interim cost recovery arrangement only. This arrangement was intended to be reviewed in light of a new market operator commencing operations. It is anticipated that the first new market operator will commence operations in the second half of 2011.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This amendment needs to come into effect as soon as possible to allow sufficient time to develop the new fees regulations. It would be preferable for the new fees regulations to be in place before competition between securities exchange markets commences.

        DETERRING PEOPLE SMUGGLING BILL
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Deterring People Smuggling Bill will ensure that Australia's people smuggling offences remain effective.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will insert a clarifying section into Subdivision A of Division 12 in Part 2 of the Migration Act 1958 to clarify the phrase no lawful right to come to Australia means that a non citizen who does not have visa that is in effect, and who does not fall within one of the exceptions to section 42 of the Migration Act, does not have a lawful right to come to Australia for the purposes of the people smuggling offences in the Migration Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Accordingly, people smuggling offences will continue to be interpreted in accordance with the intention of the Parliament in 1999 as applying where a person organises or facilitates the entry, or proposed entry, of another person into Australia, where that person had, or has, no lawful right to come to Australia under domestic law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will not affect the rights of individuals seeking protection or asylum. The clarification will operate retrospectively from December 1999, and apply to offences committed or suspected to have been committed from that time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These amendments are necessary to ensure that the provisions operate in accordance with the intention of the Parliament when it enacted and amended people smuggling offences in the Migration Act.

       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill represents the first major reforms to Australian extradition and mutual assistance legislation since they were first introduced over 20 years ago. Amendments in the Bill will make important updates to equip Australian authorities with the law enforcement tools they need to cooperate effectively with their international counterparts to investigate and prosecute crime in the modern technological age. Following two stages of extensive consultation, passage of the Bill in the Spring 2011 sittings will implement important updates and improvements to the extradition and mutual assistance regimes. It will also allow law enforcement authorities earlier access to these important tools.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill also introduces efficiencies to the extradition process. The timely passage of the Bill will allow these amendments to be implemented sooner; potentially reducing the number of delays, including the amount of time a person spends in custody, in new and ongoing extradition cases.

        There is ambiguity in HESA about its application to Australian citizens studying at the overseas campuses of Australian universities. Given the move to a demand driven system as of 1 January 2012, the Department needs to ensure that CSPs and access to HELP schemes are offered in line with the Government's policy intentions.

        The National Health Reform Agreement provides further details of new funding arrangements. Under that Agreement the IHPA is to be established permanently by 31 December 2011.

       <p class="italic">
        The IHPA also needs to be established as soon as possible to undertake work required to meet the 1 July 2012 deadline for the new funding arrangements for Australian hospitals. Passage of the legislation in the Spring sittings will accommodate the administrative arrangements necessary to establish the agency. This will include appointing the board, recruiting the

        , organising accommodation, recruiting specialist staff, developing business practices and support services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage in Spring will also provide time to put in place strong governance and mature technical capabilities to support arrangements for activity based funding. This is critical to ensure funds are spent transparently and accountably on efficiently delivering services to public patients through public hospitals.
