        Earlier this week I met with participants in the Pacific Australia Emerging Leaders Summit. My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. Can you tell us how the Albanese Labor government is building stronger partnerships with the countries of the Pacific family and the Pacific region as a whole and how that is going?

             I thank Senator Bilyk and I apologise that Senator Birmingham and I were so engrossed that I didn't hear a question that I had in fact spoken with her about the importance of asking. I acknowledge and will come to those members of the Pacific family who are here today in the gallery.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are seeking to build a stronger Pacific family by showing up and listening, by acting on climate change and by boosting our security cooperation and development assistance. The government's investment in maritime security, climate action, labour mobility, health and education will help our regional co-partners become more economically resilient, develop critical infrastructure and provide their own security. The investments the Albanese government has put in place will deliver on our commitments to build a stronger and more united Pacific family and a peaceful, prosperous and resilient region.

             Australia is a proud founding member of the SPC, which is the largest scientific and technical regional organisation in the Pacific. For 75 years SPC has brought the Pacific together in the Pacific way for members to achieve our shared ambitions and face our shared challenges. I know Minister Conroy was so pleased to represent Australia in this important forum.

                I thank Senator Bilyk. One of the things that we have been very focused on communicating is that our partnerships in the region will be guided by Pacific priorities. Communities and leaders across the blue Pacific have been clear about the impact of the three Cs. This was part of the discussion of the leaders discussion at the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands_Forum" rel="nofollow">
                 Pacific Islands Forum
                </a>
                . The three Cs are climate, COVID and contest. This is articulated in the

                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Pacific" rel="nofollow">

                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
                 UN
                </a>
                when this was launched. It is a vision for the Pacific's economic, environmental and strategic future written by and written for Pacific nations and Pacific peoples. At the heart is the simple concept that the Pacific knows best what its priorities are and how to achieve them.
