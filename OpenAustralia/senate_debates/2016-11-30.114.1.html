        My question is to Senator Nash, the Minister representing the Minister for Health. A friend of mine is trying to quit smoking, but after a while without a cigarette he gets terrible headaches. Pretty soon, he is smoking again. He would love to try e-cigarettes, as he could if he were in Britain. Public Health England say they are 95 per cent less harmful to health than cigarettes, but your Poisons Standard does not allow e-cigarettes, even though it allows cigarettes. Can you explain this without relying on the story of the never-ending in-house review; and can you explain why companies that make nicotine patches are invited to the biennial meetings of the

        , but companies that make e-cigarettes are not?

         I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for his question and for the advance notice of it, and I note his ongoing interest in this area. The senator is indeed correct that currently e-cigarettes containing nicotine are not available for commercial sale in Australia. This is as a result of the current national and state and territory laws.
        </p>
        <p>
         The TGA Act, as I am sure the senator knows very well, and its associated regulations provide the national regulatory controls to ensure the timely availability of the therapeutic goods that have been assessed for quality, safety and efficacy to help people quit smoking. I can advise the chamber that e-cigarettes have yet to be approved through this process. As I understand it, the TGA is currently considering an application. I note the senator's reference to 'ongoing review', but I think even he would understand that the TGA processes are there for a reason—to ensure the safety and efficacy of these products, medicines and medical devices. That application is currently before the TGA. I think people across this country do expect a level of robustness when it comes to determining the safety and efficacy of products such as these.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the attendance of companies involved in e-cigarettes at the framework, the invitations, as I understand it, are a matter for the secretariat of the

           When my friend gets a headache, like millions of Australians he finds headache tablets that include codeine are most effective. But he understands that moves are afoot to reschedule codeine as a prescription-only medicine under the Poisons Standard. That means he will need to get a prescription if he wants to continue taking tablets containing codeine for his headaches in future. Can you advise whether this is the case?

            The decisions made in relation to medicines such as codeine are not made by politicians, and I expect people across Australia are very happy that they are not. They are made by independent experts in these types of areas.
           </p>
           <p>
            My understanding is that the TGA have received many submissions in relation to this issue of codeine moving to being prescription only, and that they have deferred a final decision on this while they are awaiting further information so they can consider it and take further advice.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pharmacy_Guild_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">

            , I understand, is involved in this process, in providing information to the TGA when it comes to MedAssist. I think it is very appropriate that those companies and those health professionals are involved in advising the TGA in terms of this process.

               They're not a donor yet either! But there is a proposal to tax sugary drinks based on the silly idea that if my friend gets fat and ends up working less and paying less tax then he is doing the rest of us a disservice. Can you confirm that this government will never introduce a sugar tax?

                    Unlike those opposite, I am not going to make any assumptions about Senator Leyonhjelm's friend, but I do note that I am sure his friend will be very happy that Senator Leyonhjelm is speaking on his behalf.

                    I can indicate to the chamber that a sugar tax is not government policy. On this side of the chamber, we absolutely believe that people need to be well informed when it comes to making their decisions about appropriate food and appropriate diet. That is why we put in place the Health Star Rating system, which is incredibly successful in informing people about making healthy food choices, and also the Healthy Food Partnership, which, I am pleased to say, I was involved in setting up to give better information to people. A sugar tax is not government policy. We certainly believe that people should take responsibility for their actions and for eating in a healthy way, but we do not support a simplistic reaction to a complex problem.
