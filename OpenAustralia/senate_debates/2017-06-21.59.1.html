        My question is to the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science. Last week it was announced by the administrators of Arrium,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_House" rel="nofollow">
         Liberty House
        </a>
        has increased its bid price. Noting that both bids are contingent on varying types and levels of federal government support and that the choice of the successful bidder is up to the committee of creditors, can the government advise what due diligence has been and will be carried out in respect of each proposal?

         I thank the honourable senator for his question, of which he gave some notice. As the good senator said, the administrator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KordaMentha" rel="nofollow">
          KordaMentha
         </a>
         has announced a preferred bidder, Newlake. It is not the government who decides the bidder; that is KordaMentha and the Arrium committee of creditors. KordaMentha have of course undertaken extensive due diligence on the validity of each of the proposals in coming to their determination. We as a government are involved in the process and are holding discussions with the preferred bidder announced by KordaMentha. The government has always said it would engage with those who have a long-term plan for Whyalla for a sustainable, globally competitive steel industry. That is what we want. We want jobs that will last there for 10, 20 and 30 years. That is what we are about.
        </p>
        <p>
         In regard to requests of government in the process, the Commonwealth and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         n governments have in place a task force that is jointly assessing any requests for government support. That task force is supported by financial and technical advisers on both sides. Any government support will of course be supported by appropriate due diligence and subject to key conditions to ensure that there is a long-term plan for Whyalla.

What is the government's view in relation to the steelmaking track record of each of the bidding entities, and what is the government's assessment of the two radically different technology options being proposed by the bidders, given that there could be Commonwealth involvement in this bid?

            The Arrium sale process is at a sensitive stage, and the process is run by
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KordaMentha" rel="nofollow">
             KordaMentha
            </a>
            , not by the government. As I have said, we are in the process of discussions with the preferred bidder as set out by KordaMentha. At this stage it would not be appropriate for me to stand up now and give a public assessment of the details of each of the bidders' proposals, which are of course confidential. As I made clear, the cross-jurisdictional task force that is looking at these matters is well supported by financial and technical advisers on both sides.
