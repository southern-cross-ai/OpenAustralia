          I thank the chamber. I will be very brief. This is not a move that we take lightly. This motion proposes and requests a reference to the Auditor-General to investigate the funding decisions that were made that led to proposed funding for the WestConnex project in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          and the Perth Freight Link in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          . On the proposal for the Auditor-General to investigate these two projects, I wrote to the Auditor-General last 9 July and then met with the Auditor-General on 12 August, proposing a reference on these very matters on the basis of the Auditor-General's excellent work on the East West Link project that effectively changed a state government in Victoria. We do not take this sort of step lightly, and in fact I think this is probably the first time that I have done something like this through a Senate motion. We think the debacle over the Perth Freight Link and WestConnex project funding absolutely is a prime candidate for the Auditor-General's careful scrutiny, and I commend this motion to the chamber.

             I thank the chamber. There are currently more than 90 active large projects across the country. The Perth Freight Link is a good project.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Infrastructure Australia
             </a>
             has identified that the project will address a nationally significant problem, aligns with strategic priorities and delivers economic benefits. WestConnex is also a good project. The economic benefits to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             are estimated to exceed $20 billion. Recent enhancements to WestConnex are designed to improve the performance of the overall Sydney motorway network—for example, by adding a connection for a future western harbour road crossing. Infrastructure Australia is currently reviewing the revised business case and has considered earlier business cases. Both Perth Freight Link and WestConnex have been funded after project evaluations.
