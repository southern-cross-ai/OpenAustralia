        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. Can the minister confirm that, on average, Australian women retire with 42 per cent less super than men or $113,000 less? Will the Prime Minister support Labor's plan to invest $400 million to boost women's super and help women plan for a secure financial future and have dignity in retirement?

         We will continue to consider all options to help boost women's superannuation. But let me point out that the coalition has a very proud track record when it comes to introducing real, tangible measures to help women save for their retirement, including of course the low-income superannuation tax offset, which benefits around 1.9 million women by over $500 million; levelling the playing field by scrapping restrictions on who can make personal deductible contributions, benefitting 800,000 Australians, including those women who are working in roles without access to formal salary sacrificing arrangements—

           , the question required a response to some specific requests. I asked whether the minister could confirm that women retire on 42 per cent less super than men or $113,000 less. Could the minister go to the detail of the question and say whether he will support Labor, rather than go on with his list?

             . In response to the substantive question at the end of the Senate's question, I said that the government would continue to consider all options to help boost women's super. But I am also pointing out our very strong track record, including our measure to enable catch-up concessional contributions, which will benefit 230,000 Australian, including those women with interrupted work patterns or irregular income, such as farmers and carers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, what Labor will do is increase taxes on superannuation, abolish the flexibility afforded by the government's catch-up contributions and keep restrictions on who can make personal deductible contributions. This will hurt the retirement savings of anyone with irregular income or work patterns, including mothers and carers who have taken time out of the workforce.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government has introduced the comprehensive Protecting Your Super Package, which will stop the rorts and rip-offs in the superannuation sector, providing significant benefits to the financial security of millions of Australian women. Around two million women who hold low-balance inactive accounts will be protected from erosion through excessive fees and inappropriate insurance. Around 1.6 million women who are still contributing to low-balance accounts will also see hundreds of millions of dollars—

               Can the minister confirm that older, single women are one of the fastest growing groups falling into homelessness? Why is the government refusing to match Labor's plan to invest $400 million to boost women's super, only to leave a third of older, single women to live in poverty?

                As I've already indicated, the government will continue to consider all options to boost women's super. But, of course, under Labor, women, including and in particular older women, will be worse off. Remember who announced the granny tax. Who announced the granny tax? Who wants to put their hands into the pockets of older women around Australia and increase taxes on their retirement savings? It is none other than Mr Shorten. That is what he did when he was the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation when Labor were last in government. He kept using people's retirement savings as his personal

                                 What I would say to Senator O'Neill is: look at this great bunch of people over here. What you can see here is a strong and united team working hard to make Australia stronger, to keep the economy strong, to keep Australians safe and to keep Australians together. And, yes, we will continue to work very hard to ensure that hardworking Australians who work hard all their lives and put money away for their retirement are protected from the onslaught that would come if Mr Shorten became Prime Minister, where he would put his hands into their pockets to fund Labor's reckless spending in government—as he did last time, when he was in government.
