         I thank Senator Crossin for the question and her ongoing commitment to Indigenous employment. Last week Minister Macklin announced the next phase of action for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         under the stronger futures plan. The Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory plan will build on the work we have done over the past four years to close the gap on the unacceptable levels of disadvantage still faced by Indigenous people in the Northern Territory. The stronger futures plan focused on many areas of policy concern but, at its heart, outlined strong measures to ensure Indigenous children attend school.
        </p>
        <p>
         During the extensive consultation that took place across the Territory, one of the issues that came up time and time again was access to employment and access to economic development opportunities. That is why last week Minister Macklin, Minister Burke and I announced the jobs package as part of the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory plan. It is a package of real jobs for Indigenous people. The package includes a job guarantee in the public service for all Indigenous students from Territory growth towns and remote service delivery sites who finish year 12. It is a job guarantee. It also contains a 'local jobs for local people' Indigenous traineeship measure which will provide job specific training and job shadowing for 100 job seekers over a year so that local people can take over service delivery jobs in their community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, as well, we are supporting local rangers, with 50 new Working on Country ranger positions in the Northern Territory. These positions will be ongoing. And we will support
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         who have already gained employment and skills through projects like

          SEAM
         </a>
         to transition to new employment opportunities. This is the work of the Gillard government, supporting Indigenous jobs across the Territory. It builds on the work through the shire package, which was a $4.8 million commitment made through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEP" rel="nofollow">
          IEP
         </a>
         , supporting 530 jobs in the shire. It builds on the work of the CDEP job conversion's 2,241 jobs—

           The Gillard government is proud that, since coming to office, we have created over 700,000 jobs for working Australians. But, at the same time, we have partnered and worked with community organisations and also, importantly, with business to try to ensure that those jobs are sustainable in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
           One of the most important and iconic projects in the Territory is the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayers_Rock_Resort" rel="nofollow">
            Ayers Rock Resort
           </a>
           . This is a resort that has had a very poor Indigenous employment record in the past. Up until recently they had two Indigenous employees. There were only two Indigenous employees at one of the most iconic projects and tourism sites in the country. Working with the Indigenous Land Corporation and Voyages Indigenous Tourism Australia we are ensuring that that facility employs Indigenous people. The Gillard government is providing $4.9 million through the

             </a>
             is contributing significantly to employment and training. They will provide a further 150 trainees as well as cover a variety of operating costs. This will become a training hub and employment generating facility in the Territory but also it will attract

             from across the country in the tourism and hospitality sectors to be trained at this hotel, which will create employment in tourism across the country. It is an important part of the government's policies and we are working, as I said, very closely with the ILC and with business.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the same time, the ILC recognises that we need to encourage Indigenous small businesses and Indigenous economic development through the facility. The ILC will be employing a business development officer to work with local businesses on procurement strategies to try to ensure that we drive Indigenous businesses, because we know when we are supporting Indigenous businesses we are creating Indigenous jobs.
