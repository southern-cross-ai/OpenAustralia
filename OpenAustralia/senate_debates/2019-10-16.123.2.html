        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Cash. Will the minister update the Senate on what life-changing cancer medications will now be made available on the

         I think that this is without a doubt one of the proudest achievements of the coalition government, and I certainly know it is one of the proudest achievements of the Minister for Health—that is, of course, being able to utilise the benefits of a strong economy to actually put drugs on to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
         </a>
         , but in particular life-changing cancer medications. I don't think anybody in here would say that they have not personally been touched by cancer or, alternatively, know someone who is very close to them that has been touched by cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a result of the dividends of a strong economy, the minister has recently listed medicines to treat lung cancer, lymphoblastic and acute leukaemia and the nausea associated with chemotherapy, which affect more than half a million patients. That's a good dividend. But we are also saving them up to $100,000 per course of treatment. We have also listed Tecentriq and Avastin. This will help a number of patients suffering with certain types of lung cancers. Without the PBS subsidy, access to this life-changing medicine would cost patients more than $11,400 per script or more than $189,100 per course of treatment. We have also extended the listing of Besponsa. This will assist many patients suffering from lymphoblastic and acute leukaemia. Again, without this listing of this drug, patients would pay more than $44,500 per script or more than $122,900 per course of treatment. That is why we have a plan. That is why we will not deviate from our plan, because these are real dividends of a strong economy.

            Again, this is all about the dividends of a strong economy. Since being elected to government in 2013 our government, the coalition government, has invested $10.6 billion to make over 2,200 new or amended medicine listings on the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
             Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
            </a>
            . We're averaging around 31 new or amended listings per month. That now equates to approximately one per day. Many medicines would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and, let's be frank, they would be out of reach for many, but because of our management of the economy we are able to make these listings and patients will pay $40.30, or $6.50 per script. Again, we understand, on this side of the chamber, the benefits of a strong economy, and one of those benefits is being able to list drugs on the PBS.

               I will take Senator Bilyk's interjection. I acknowledge everything Senator Bilyk went through, and it is so fantastic to have you here. In a few weeks time my little sister's anniversary comes up—four years to the day that she lost her life from cancer. The drugs she needed were not on the PBS, so my family did everything we could to ensure that she was able to access those drugs, no matter what the drug was. What did we do in return? We bought some time to create memories. Please, these are the benefits of a strong economy. This is a government that gets out there and delivers for Australians. Access to life-saving drugs should never be made political. We should always deliver for Australians. Access to benefits, including life-changing drugs for cancer, is a dividend of a strong economy.
