        As I indicated in my speech in the second reading debate, there are some issues with these bills. One of the key issues is the lack of defined parameters on labour market testing, simply leaving it to ministerial discretion. Minister, could you advise whether any parameters have been determined by the minister in relation to labour market testing?

         I am advised by the minister of the proposed settings, which I'll go through. The period of labour market testing is a minimum of 21 calendar days. The date of labour market testing is six months before lodgement, four months since redundancies. The number of advertisements is at least two. The method of advertising could take a number of formats, but should consist of at least two of the following: a national recruitment website, such as jobactive.gov.au; recruitment agencies; internal advertising, for intracompany transfers; business website or social media, of accredited sponsors; and national print media or radio. The required information in the advertisement is position title and description; salary, which is waived if the salary is higher than the high-income threshold; and company and recruitment agency—company name need not be disclosed if using a recruitment agency. Advertising language requirements are English; any other language is optional. The evidence requirements are copy of advertisements or equivalent evidence. The exemptions are: where a new nomination is required for an existing visa holder because of a change in business structure or pay; where labour market testing is not appropriate due to the nature of the position, such as sporting athletes, top talent chefs, eminent academics; and where an international trade obligation applies. That's the advice I have to hand.

              I appreciate that. From my rough notes: as you went through quite a range of issues, you did talk about chefs. Why would chefs not be part of an advertisement for suitably qualified Australian workers?

                      Given Minister Dutton's past performance as recently as, I think, last week, when he made some really disparaging remarks to workers in the gallery—I think he got himself confused, as he normally seems to be, about what area these workers came from—how can we be assured that workers in a certain area of the labour market won't be discriminated against because of the bias of the minister?

You're saying that he would, when exercising his discretion, not exercise it in a biased way. Wouldn't that then mean that there should be regulations applying to it and the exercise of discretion should be removed from a who that has shown such bias?

                          I suppose we will have to agree to disagree on that position. Given that the minister has discretion, what areas of discretion could he exercise in relation to an employer seeking to bring in skilled workers?

                                  That leaves an opportunity for different ministerial discretion for different areas. Why wouldn't there be a standardised inclusion within the bill? Is there any reason why these points that you read out were not included in the bill to give people an understanding of how it would work?

                                   There's no intention to have an instrument that varies from the six months, but, as is common with a range of legislation, elements of detail are often put in place by way of regulation rather than in the primary legislation.

                                        Do you have any idea how many workers are coming into the country under the various so-called free trade agreements—they are actually bilateral preferential trade agreements; is that correct? They are actually bilateral preferential agreements, not free trade agreements?

                                          You're going to provide the details. Let's just take the China bilateral agreement. I've got to say that I'm surprised that anyone associated with the minister's department is unaware of the difference between a 'real' free trade agreement and a bilateral preferential agreement. I think it's clear that these are bilateral preferential trade agreements. You'll confirm that, I hope.

                                          So let's take one of the bilateral preferential trade agreements: say, China. In what areas would a company be able to bring in, say, Chinese mechanical or electrical tradespeople without having any need for labour market testing?

They include skills and experience, English, evidence of meeting a specified test and being a genuine temporary entrant. Those discretionary criteria are the ones which have been advised to me, but, obviously, if you have any further follow-up questions, please do so.

But obviously, in that case too, there need to be assessments on the basis of the facts.

                                                      Minister, can I then draw your attention to article 10.4, 'Grant of Temporary Entry', under the China Free Trade Agreement. I will take you to subparagraph (3) in that agreement. It says:
                                                     </p>

                                                          Okay, so that's for temporary entry. I now take you to 'Article 10.4: Grant of Temporary Entry'. It's on page 113 of the China-Australia so-called free trade agreement. It says:
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p class="italic">
                                                          In respect of the specific commitments on temporary entry in this Chapter, unless otherwise specified in Annex 10-A, neither Party shall:
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p class="italic">
                                                          (a) impose or maintain any limitations on the total number of visas to be granted to natural persons of the other Party; or
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p class="italic">
                                                          (b) require labour market testing, economic needs testing or other procedures of similar effect as a condition for temporary entry.
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>
                                                          So the minister would not be applying any discretion to Chinese tradespeople entering the country in this context, would he?

This is not a hypothetical; this could be the Inland Rail that Minister Joyce keeps telling us will be built. If there is an 'employee of an enterprise of China established in Australia through a branch, subsidiary or affiliate which is lawfully and actively operating in Australia', they can fill a position in the branch, subsidiary or affiliate of the enterprise in Australia. Then it goes through (a), (b) and (c). In (b) it talks about:
                                                               </p>

                                                                … a specialist, who is a natural person with advanced trade, technical or professional skills and experience who must be assessed as having the necessary qualifications, or alternative credentials accepted as meeting Australia's standards, for that occupation, and who must have been employed by the employer for not less than two years immediately preceding the date of the application for temporary entry.
                                                               </p>

                                                                This is part of the intracorporate transfer. Could you just confirm this: if a Chinese company establishes a subsidiary or affiliate in Australia and then brings skilled trade, technical or professional people in, they would not be subject to labour market testing?

Trade agreements provide for commitments with respect to categories of entrant such as the intracorporate transferees that Senator Cameron referred to. Whether a visa applicant falls within scope of a commitment would depend on their individual circumstances.

It doesn't depend on that individual's circumstances; it depends on the terms of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. And the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement means that any labour market testing would be redundant in the context of a Chinese company using a subsidiary to build the inland rail, or of a Chinese company or subsidiary building an extension to a mine or installing equipment, because the agreement says 'installers and servicers of China'. Subclause 12 says:
                                                                   </p>

                                                                    Entry and temporary stay shall be granted to installers and servicers of China for a period of up to three months.
                                                                   </p>
                                                                   <p>

Those installers could come in for a period of three months to install or service the machinery and equipment without any labour market testing. Is that correct?

When I was talking earlier about individual circumstances, I was speaking in the context of individual circumstances determining whether a visa applicant falls within the scope of the matters that we have been discussing in relation to the free trade agreement. I just observe in passing that both the Liberals and Labor, when in government, have signed free trade agreements where there are exemptions in certain circumstances.

While I'm again on my feet, I might just table the 'Migration determination of international trade obligations relating to labour market testing instrument 2017', which is a draft, which I'm happy to provide. We have only one copy, so I'll table that and you'll have it shortly, Senator.

You say 'at least two'. It refers to 'The method of advertising'. It says, 'This could take a number of formats that should consist of at least two of the following'. So you've got to pick two of the five that are indicated in the document. What other formats in addition to this are you looking at?

It could include other formats, but it needs to include at least two of these listed. There aren't at the moment other formats being looked at to be added to the list out of which you need to have at least two. There could be other formats, but you do need to choose at least two of these five.

When you talk about formats—sorry to do this to you, Senator, because I know this is not your area, but I really need to try to get some idea of this. Maybe the advisers could tell you why they needed to say that a number of additional formats, as you've just explained, could be there. Why do you need additional formats? Can you give me any idea of what these formats could look like?

So this is recognising that there will be other formats. There are, no doubt, other formats at the moment, but at least two of those listed will need to be included. I will see if there are any other particular formats that the department have in mind that currently exist.

So it would be good if you could come back to me on that—what other formats you are considering. Let's forget the other formats at the moment, because you don't know what they are. You could have a national recruitment website or national print media and radio—that could be one aspect—but, as I read this, you could have a recruitment agency advertising and you could combine that with internal advertising for intracompany transfers. Does that satisfy the labour market testing?

You could have, say, workers in Ballarat and a company in Ballarat, but that company would not even be advertising in print in Ballarat. So the recruitment agency that some workers would not even know existed could advertise and the company could do internal advertising, and that's it. Is that seriously the position?

If you're going to provide the operating manual or procedures manual, that's good. What would happen if the company advertises internally and the recruitment agency is not a national recruitment agency? Is that satisfactory? Does that satisfy labour market testing?

What accredited sponsors would be able to use social media or their business's website?

When the business uses social media, could that be a single tweet? Could that be a Facebook post that goes up for one minute? As Senator Molan knows, Facebook posts can go up and come down—and can disappear, Senator Molan! We know all about Facebook posts. So what's the situation there?

The decision-maker does need to be satisfied that the steps are genuine and that the market has been tested.

If you want to negotiate bilaterals, surely the states and territories need some confidence that, if they are committing funding, the government can provide the funding in the forward estimates.

These are designed to make sure, if we've got labour market testing, that the labour market testing is understood, that it is genuine and that those employers that want to bring in overseas workers properly test the local market. It's to make sure that there are no suitably qualified and experienced local workers readily available who cannot get access to the employment to fill the positions.

The government's bill asks Australians to trust the immigration minister. For anyone listening in, if you know the immigration minister, you should be very, very wary about that. It's also saying that the immigration minister will do the right thing. Watching the immigration minister in action, who would assume this minister would do the right thing in a legislative instrument? He has proved time and time again that he can't be trusted to do the right thing and protect labour market testing. This is a minister who actually attacks working people, and attacks them outrageously, from the coward's castle of the floor of the House of Representatives. When workers are sitting in the viewing areas of the chamber trying to see how this system is working, to see how parliament's working, Minister Dutton attacks them. It is absolutely outrageous.

Labor's amendments that are before the Senate now would ensure that labour market testing is advertised for a minimum of four weeks, that it has been conducted no more than four months before the nomination of a worker on a skilled visa, and that it is targeted in such a way that a significant proportion of suitably qualified and experienced Australian citizens or Australian permanent residents would be likely to be informed about the position. And it would ensure that there are not unrealistic and unwarranted experience requirements for vacant positions with the effect of excluding otherwise suitable Australian applicants.

We will always fight for strict labour market testing that ensures local workers get the first shot at jobs. On that basis I call on and appeal to the Senate to be consistent with what the Senate did in the ABCC bill and protect Australian workers, because, as you've heard in the responses in this committee debate, there is a complete lack of clarity and credibility in what the government is proposing. It is absolutely essential, in my view, that the amendments we propose on sheet 8372 are adopted.

The employment of 457 visa holders is a contentious issue, especially when it is perceived that foreigners are taking jobs from Australians.

There is no distinction between skilled and unskilled visa holders and no distinction between small family operations and large multinationals. They both need to pay a levy. How is it a viable situation for a single mum running a coffee cart or, like me previously, a publican and small-business operator? We are slugged with a $1,200 fee while trying to staff the business.

This is an unreasonable ask when, in a lot of cases, the bush hotels, the corner stores or the mums' coffee carts run on very slim margins. I will be supporting this bill. However, there needs to be a distinction made. As such, I propose an exemption for businesses with a turnover of less than $5 million per year. We need to ensure that, in the process of looking after some Australians, we are not making it harder for others.

The only crossbencher who came over to that side and voted against the amendments, voted against the interests of Australian workers, then has the hide to stand up here and say that he is supporting Australian workers. You voted against Australian workers, Senator Anning.

We will not be supporting it, because you have got your values and principles in the wrong place on this issue. Hopefully, in the future, you will make up for it and not continually vote with a government that doesn't care about Australian workers, a government that cuts penalty rates, a government that wants to give $65 billion to big business while it's increasing tax on ordinary Australians. You've just got your priorities wrong on this one, Senator Anning, because—I'll tell you—if you continually vote with the government, you won't be here for long, because they are on their way out. They are a divided rabble of a government, a government that just can't concentrate on the issues of importance for Australian workers. They are an absolute rabble of a government. They don't care about Australian workers.
