         The Australian Government has plans for providing Australian Government physical assistance in response to such requests. The Australian Government Disaster Response Plan (COMDISPLAN) describes the arrangements for centralised coordination of the provision of Australian Government physical assistance within Australia. This plan can be activated for any disaster or emergency regardless ofthe cause. COMDISPLAN was first adopted in December

It is about the array of challenges we might face over the next generation and the role of Defence in meeting those challenges. The FSR is a classified review and the Government is not considering releasing sections of the FSR Report. The 2009 DWP noted that in the event of Australia making contributions to conventional combat in the region, our planning would need to take into account retaliatory action being taken against us (paras

         As stated in the 2009 Defence White Paper, Australia is one of the most physically secure countries in the world and Australia will most likely remain a secure country over the period to 2030 (paras 3.7 and 6.23). In the event of a crisis, Australian defence policy acknowledges the value to Australia of the protection afforded by extended nuclear deterrence under the US Alliance. Under extended nuclear deterrence, as long as nuclear weapons exist, we can rely on US nuclear forces to deter nuclear attack on Australia.

          The Government

         does not intend to speculate on hypothetical scenarios but will continue to regularly consider its judgements concerning the risk of nuclear attack, including in the 2013 Defence White Paper.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Successive Australian Governments have acknowledged that joint facilities could be targeted in conflict, but also emphasised that Australia's hosting of these facilities contributes to a stable system of global deterrence.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Successive Australian Governments have acknowledged US policy to neither confirm nor deny the presence or absence of nuclear weapons at any location. US officials have stated that it is not US practice to carry nuclear weapons on training flights, and US Administrations have previously stated that in normal circumstances US naval aircraft and ships no longer carry nuclear weapons.

         As with any disaster or civil emergency, appropriate resources would be made available. Under Australia's constitutional arrangements, State and Territory Governments have responsibility, within their borders, for coordinating and planning for the response to and recovery from disasters and civil emergencies. If further resources are required, the State Government or Territory Controller can seek assistance from the Australian Government. Further detail should be sought from the Minister for Health.

         The 2009 DWP judged that Australia is one of the most physically secure countries in the world and that Australia will most likely remain a secure country over the period to 2030. Defence's current advice is that the 2009 DWP judgements remain sound.

         Humanitarian and environmental consequences of the use of nuclear weapons inform the Government's policies on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Australia is committed to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons. The Government acknowledges that nuclear attack would be potentially devastating. Australia is a party to, and fully implements non-proliferation and disarmament treaties, including those prohibiting weapons of mass destruction and inhumane conventional weapons.

         Australia has made a sustained contribution to the international consideration of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, including through the 1996 Report of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination ofNuclear Weapons. More recently, the independent International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament (ICNND), established by Australia and Japan, reinvigorated international efforts on the issue. The Commission's report made a significant contribution to the success of the 2010 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (
