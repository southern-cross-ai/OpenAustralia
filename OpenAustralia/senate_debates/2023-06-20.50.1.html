        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness, Senator Farrell. The Albanese Labor government has set an ambitious agenda delivering housing for vulnerable Australians, Australians who were left behind by a decade of inaction on housing and homelessness under the former Liberal-National government. Can the minister, please, outline some of the measures the Albanese government is delivering to help address the housing challenges for Australians needing a safe and affordable place to call home?

         I thank Senator O'Neill for her question and her deep interest in this issue. The Albanese government wants every Australian to have the security of having a roof over their head.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Albanese government's ambitious housing agenda is already delivering solutions, like the $2 billion social housing accelerator to deliver thousands of new social housing homes right across Australia. Secondly, it provides an extra $67.5 million to states and territories to help tackle homelessness. Thirdly, it introduces incentives to increase investments and build-to-rent accommodation. Fourthly, it increases the maximum rate of Commonwealth rent assistance by 15 per cent. Fifthly, it establishes a new National Housing Accord, making up to $575 million available through the National Housing Infrastructure Facility for more homes, and invests an additional $2 billion in financing the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation to buy a program to help more people by a home sooner. Finally, it will expand the Home Guarantee Scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
         This brings the Albanese government's investment in housing and homelessness to more than $9.5 billion in this financial year. At every opportunity the Albanese government has built on our housing work because we know that our nation's housing challenges are serious. Others in this place may want to play political games with housing for those in need, but the Albanese government will not be deterred. We will continue delivering to ensure more Australians have a safe and affordable place to call home.

           Thank you very much, Minister, for that expose of practical action that's making a big difference in people's lives. Many of the government's initiatives are underway and already delivering new homes. Can the minister provide an update to the Senate on how the Albanese government's ambitious reform agenda is delivering new homes now for Australians who need them?

            Yes, I can, Senator O'Neill. The Albanese government has hit the ground running and is already delivering on its housing commitments. The Minister for Housing has announced and visited many of the new developments and homes our reforms are delivering, projects delivering new social and affordable rental homes in places such as Westmead, Adelaide, north-west Tasmania, Brisbane and Parramatta—and that's just the start. The additional $2 billion social housing accelerator we have announced will deliver thousands of new social housing homes right across this country. And while the Greens are prepared to band with the coalition to play political games, the Albanese government takes Australia's housing affordability challenges seriously, and we are not wasting a day to deliver those solutions.

              I'm very glad to hear about all this across the country and particularly glad to hear about Parramatta, where I was born. Are there any other initiatives the Labor government is seeking to pursue further that would further address housing and homelessness for vulnerable Australians? What's preventing these initiatives from coming into effect, and what will this mean for those people in need of more affordable housing?

               Yesterday, we saw the Greens stand with their new partners, in the Liberals and Nationals, to reject the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill. They've rejected it, and the 30,000 social and affordable rental homes that it would deliver in the first five years. They've rejected the ongoing pipeline of funding each and every year. They rejected funding for crisis and transitional accommodation for women and children leaving family violence. They rejected safe and suitable housing for First Nations Australians—

                 Yes, shame. And they rejected funding for homes and services for Australian veterans. It's now up to the Greens and the coalition to explain to Australians in need of affordable housing why they stood in their way. The Albanese government will instead be getting on with the job of delivering the homes that Australia needs.
