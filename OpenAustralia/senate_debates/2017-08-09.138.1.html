        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Justice, Senator Brandis. To assist in recovery from Cyclone Debbie, the Queensland government with the support of local mayors requested the Turnbull government match its contribution of $110 million in natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements category D funding. In response the Turnbull government has committed a dismal $29 million, despite the Queensland government and local councils having provided all information requested at that time. How can the minister justify the government short-changing the people of regional Queensland in this manner as they recover from the devastation of Cyclone Debbie?

         Senator Chisholm, almost every assertion in your question is an untruth. The Australian government has provided significant support to Queenslanders affected by Cyclone Debbie. Let me tell you what it has been. Before Cyclone Debbie even crossed the coast we had ADF personnel and Centrelink staff on the ground to provide assistance. We have also provided significant financial assistance. We have committed to reimbursing up to 75 per cent of the damage bill under the NDRRA, an estimated Commonwealth liability of $683 million, and more than $16.8 million to date via the disaster recovery payment and disaster recovery allowance. On top of this, we have agreed to cost share a category D support package of $58.6 million, including a $40 million betterment fund; a $15 million environment package to assist the clean-up of beaches, recreational parks, rivers and waterways; a $2.1 million economic package, which includes employing industry recovery officers to provide financial counselling to primary producers; and $1.5 million to restore and repair the

         foreshore in Whitsunday regional council and the Bluewater Trail in the Mackay regional council.
        </p>
        <p>
         The remainder of the funding requested by the state of Queensland was either unsupported by evidence or outside the scope of the NDRRA, as the Queensland government knew. In the case of the

         marina, the Queensland government provided evidence of $8.8 million of damage but also that this asset is covered by insurance.

           Does the Attorney-General agree with Minister Keenan when he says that the Queensland government was trying to 'rip off the Commonwealth and rip off our hardworking taxpayers, who ultimately foot the bill'?

            I do agree with Mr Keenan and, Senator Chisholm, I'm about to explain to you and give you some examples of why certain claims made by the Queensland government were either to its knowledge outside the scope of the NDRRA guidelines or unsupported by evidence that the government was required to provide. Let me give you another example of a claim by the Queensland government which was not based on any evidence. In the case of the Whitsunday Coast airport there was a claim for $40 million. No evidence of any damage was provided by the Queensland government in its application. In fact, in June of this year the Queensland government announced $40 million in infrastructure funding for this project—not for disaster recovery but for new infrastructure. So I think we can see what's going on there, Senator Chisholm.

               Not only have I not seen that comment by Mr Christensen, but I have learnt through long experience in this chamber not to take at face value anything attributed to coalition members by Labor senators, because so often they—not necessarily you—are lying. Let me give you a couple more examples of claims made by the Queensland government which were not supported by any evidence whatsoever. Let us take the case of the Bluewater Trail and
