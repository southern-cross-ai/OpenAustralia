        My question is to the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham. Will the minister advise the Senate on the critical importance of the
        <i>
         2016 Defence white paper
        </i>
        to education, research and jobs?

         I thank Senator Edwards for his question. Senator Edwards, like all members of the government, welcomed today's release of the
         <i>
          2016 Defence white paper
         </i>
         , which, as Senator Payne has outlined comprehensively to the chamber, sets out the coalition government's comprehensive and responsible long-term plan to ensure Australia's national security.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, the defence white paper is a valuable companion to the National Innovation and Science Agenda because in setting out, for the first time, all elements of defence investment in the future, it will spur and guide further innovation, investment and activity in science, research and entrepreneurship around Australia. It outlines for the first time how the Australian government will procure in areas such as weapons, platforms, systems, enabling equipment, facilities, workforce, information and communication technologies, science and technology—all areas providing a comprehensive suite in relation to how we equip Australia for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         It has a particularly important role, of course, for my home state and Senator Edwards' home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         . It will play a critical role in modernising and strengthening our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Defence Force
         </a>
         . In the decade to 2025-26, around $2.1 billion will be invested in upgrading Defence facilities in South Australia, with an additional $2.1 billion to be invested in upgrading Defence facilities in the decade between 2025-26 and 2035-36. Defence is already a major employer in South Australia, with around 5,800 Defence personnel based there. Today's announcement will see a rapid expansion in both the numbers of personnel and defence innovation, education, research and investment. It is one that has been warmly welcomed, including, I note, by the South Australian Premier.

           Yesterday, on behalf of the Prime Minister, I hosted the Cyber Security Challenge Australia awards ceremony. The challenge is one of the ways the government and Australian business try to address our serious cybersecurity skills shortage and secure our online environment. It provides an outstanding opportunity for students to test their foundational cybersecurity skills in a most practical way. It also exposes students to some of the most dynamic cybersecurity employers in the Australian market. It provides a 24-hour virtual computer network competition for undergraduate students. I am delighted that we saw such success, with record entrants and record numbers of women participating in this high-tech opportunity this year. These are the types of students and skills that we will need across the Australian economy, but particularly to ensure the successful implementation and meeting of the challenges that are addressed in the defence white paper. It is very important we continue to drive initiatives like the cybersecurity challenge that will complement the needs and aspirations of Australia in our Defence requirements.

             I am not. I know that in the past we have of course seen from the Labor opposition, when they were in government, unfunded white papers in 2009 and 2013, but, as Senator Payne has outlined today, this government's white paper details very clearly funding strategies as well as procurement requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
             In relation to our home state, Senator Edwards, we will see an integrated investment program that will deliver substantial benefits for
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              South Australia
             </a>
             . Premier Weatherill has said that it is great news and a great win for South Australia, something that we should all welcome. It will include the acquisition of 15 P8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft. It will ensure upgrade of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
              RAAF
             </a>
             Base at Edinburgh, with around a $600 million investment in the site. Of course, the centrepiece is the continuous build program for Australia, including the nine future frigates that have been announced will be built in Adelaide from 2020, as well as the government's substantial commitment to the offshore patrol vessels and the submarines in the future.
