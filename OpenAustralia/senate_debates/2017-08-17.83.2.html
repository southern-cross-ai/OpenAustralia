        The committee is considering the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017, as amended, and opposition amendments (40) and (41) on sheet 8144, moved by Senator Cameron. The question is that the amendments be agreed to.

         Yesterday, during the committee stage, there was an agreement between the opposition and Senator Xenophon that we would have some discussions on certain aspects of the bill. For obvious reasons, we haven't been in a position to get together with Senator Xenophon to deal with that, so I would, with the concurrence with the minister, be happy to have either Senator Leyonhjelm or the minister move to their amendments so that we can have time to discuss the issues.

             (5) Schedule 1, item 13, page 7 (lines 14 to 17), omit subsection 557B(1), substitute:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             (1) For the purposes of subsection 557A(1), a body corporate knowingly contravenes a civil remedy provision if the body corporate expressly, tacitly or impliedly authorised the contravention.
            </p>
            <p>
             These amendments are clarifying amendments. Item (4) amends section 557A to clarify that an accessory may be liable for a higher penalty under the serious contraventions regime if they are involved in a serious contravention by the principal wrongdoer and knew that the principal's contravention was a serious contravention. The amendment flows from the Senate committee report in relation to this bill and basically clarifies when an accessory may be subject to the proposed higher penalties for serious contraventions. It clarifies that anyone who knowingly involves themselves in the deliberate and systematic underpayment of workers will face the higher penalties that apply to that conduct. This approach is consistent with the current approach to accessorial liability under section 550 of the Fair Work Act, under which an alleged accessory must have knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention to be liable for that contravention.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the second amendment: I propose to amend section 557A(1) of the bill to clarify the existing intention that a contravention is deliberate in the context of the serious contraventions regime if the person knowingly contravened the provision. Again, this amendment responds to the Senate committee report and clarifies what a wrongdoer needs to know before they can be held responsible for a serious contravention. The amendment uses language and concepts already used elsewhere under the Fair Work Act and so should be easier to understand and apply. It also means that, for the higher penalties under the serious contraventions regime to apply, the wrongdoer must knowingly contravene the provision and it must form part of a systematic pattern of conduct.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the final amendment that I have moved: I propose to amend section 557A(2) of the bill to add an additional matter to the non-exhaustive list of matters that a court may consider when determining whether a person's conduct was part of a systematic pattern of conduct. Again, the purpose of the amendment is to respond to the Senate committee report and it sets out additional guidance about when a contravention may qualify as serious. This amendment improves the operation of the bill by ensuring that employers who do the right thing by quickly and decisively responding to complaints about underpayments that are brought to their attention are not subjected to higher penalties. On the other hand, it will be relevant to the court's consideration if employers repeatedly fail to respond to wage complaints without a reasonable excuse. Again, these amendments are technical amendments that respond to the Senate committee's report, and I commend them to the Senate.

                We understand that the intention of this provision is to clarify what constitutes accessorial liability for serious contraventions. It arises from concerns raised with the Senate employment committee by Professor Andrew Stewart in his submission. Can the minister clarify proposed section 557A(5A)(b)? The statement is that the involved person knew that the principal's contravention was a serious contravention and it requires the involved person to know. Is it that the principal's conduct was part of a systemic pattern of conduct involving one or more persons, or is it something more than that?
