        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Gallagher. On 16 February, the Australian Border Force issued a media release entitled '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABF" rel="nofollow">
         ABF
        </a>
        operation in Western Australia' in response to media reports that at least one illegal venture had arrived near
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Beagle Bay
        </a>
        . Ministers have since publicly acknowledged the arrival of a vessel. Will the minister confirm when this illegal venture arrived, how many boats there were and how many illegal maritime arrivals were on board?

         I thank Senator Paterson for the question. We won't be commenting on operational matters or seeking to politicise national security and border protection, unlike those opposite. We're not going to assist the people-smuggling business. We have a large border, as everyone knows, so boat arrivals do happen from time to time, and we saw that under your government, Senator Paterson. We had a very similar situation to what recently occurred in WA, in Queensland.
        </p>
        <p>
         What is critical is that Operation Sovereign Borders remains in place, and the good and capable and qualified staff, who are operating Operation Sovereign Borders, are doing their job. That's what we in this parliament should expect them to do. We don't want to politicise it. I know those opposite do, and I would draw the senator's attention to the comments of Rear Admiral Brett Sonter, who said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The mission of Operation Sovereign Borders remains the same today as … when it was established in 2013: protect Australian borders, combat people smuggling in our region, and importantly, prevent people from risking their lives at sea. Any alternate narrative will be exploited by criminal people smugglers to deceive potential irregular immigrants and convince them to risk their lives and travel to Australia by boat.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think all senators should be assured that Operation Sovereign Borders is working. When there is a boat arrival, those who might make it onto mainland Australia are removed from the country. They will not be resettled in this country. The policy remains the same as it was under the former government.

           When asked about Labor's position on border protection on 26 April 2022, the Prime Minister, who was then the opposition leader, said, 'The same policy that exists now, Operation Sovereign Borders, will apply under us.' Can the minister confirm that it is the government's intention to abolish temporary protection visas, a core pillar of Operation Sovereign Borders?

            I thank Senator Paterson for the question. The policy of Operation Sovereign Borders hasn't changed. It remains in place. The same policy the former government had remains the policy of this government, and it is working. It's protecting borders, it's combating people smuggling and it's preventing lives being lost at sea. Where we do have a boat arrive, as we saw in the last week or so, those people are removed from this country, and they will not resettle in this country. But we are fixing up a broken immigration system.

                As I said, Operation Sovereign Borders policy architecture remains unchanged, and I would again remind those who seek to politicise this issue—as we understand the opposition always seeks to do; it's their default position—of the comments from the Commander Joint Agency Task Force, Operation Sovereign Borders, which say that 'any alternate narrative will be exploited by others'—

                      Temporary protection visas were part of the question, but it also went to the whole issue around Australia's border, and the minister is being relevant. Minister, did you wish to continue?
