       <p>
        by leave—I speak today to update the parliament and the Australian people about Australia's missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Since my last statement in December 2013 there have been significant developments in Australia's mission in Afghanistan and this year has seen the commencement of the ADF mission in Iraq. There have been significant developments in Australia's mission in Afghanistan, including the completion of our mission in Uruzgan province and the historic transition of power to the national unity government of President Ghani and Chief Executive Officer Abdullah.
       </p>
       <p>
        I most recently visited Afghanistan in September of this year. My visit gave me the opportunity to see the progress being made. I also saw firsthand the work being carried out by our military and civilian personnel to support Afghanistan to ensure that its security, freedom and economy continue to develop. I met with senior Australian,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">
         ISAF
        </a>
        and Afghan commanders and had an opportunity to address Australian troops serving in national and coalition appointments in Kabul.
       </p>
       <p>
        After 13 years the largest military coalition in recent history, the ISAF mission, will conclude at the end of 2014 as planned. Our Afghan partner, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Security_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Afghan National Security Force
        </a>
        , has grown in confidence and capability and is now in the lead for combat operations throughout Afghanistan. Challenges remain, but the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSF" rel="nofollow">
         ANSF
        </a>
        continues to demonstrate its ability to plan and conduct independent and combined operations to protect the Afghan people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, Australia lost another soldier this year, Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey, in a non-combat related incident in Afghanistan. Our mission in Afghanistan has come at a heavy cost, with the loss of 41
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        personnel and another 261 wounded. Our thoughts are with Lance Corporal Chidgey's family. They are not alone in their sorrow.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the ISAF chapter closes, I think the ADF can look back with honour and pride in what it has achieved in Afghanistan. I am confident that we will continue with the same professionalism and dedication post-2014. It remains the Australian government's strong view that it is in Australia's interest to remain engaged in Afghanistan as part of this overall effort. Australia is committed to supporting security and stability in Afghanistan beyond 2014 through cooperation in security, diplomatic and development channels, and continuing to build the capacity of Afghanistan's national institutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, our aid program will continue to build on and protect the gains of the last decade, supporting economic growth and governance, the empowerment of Afghan women and girls in particular, and at-risk populations. This has been quite remarkable. Australia has pledged to contribute to the post-2014
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">

        -led train, advise and assist mission and our current contributions provide a good foundation for Australia's post-2014 commitment to Afghanistan.
       </p>
       <p>
        The end of 2014 will also mark the conclusion of

       </p>
       <p>
        On 1 March 2014, Prime Minister Abbott announced that Australia will have an Anzac Day style national commemoration for the war in Afghanistan to ensure that the bitter experience of returning Vietnam veterans is not repeated for those who have served in Australia's longest war. It is important for the Australian people to have the opportunity during a nationwide commemoration activity to say thank you to the men and women who have served in the Middle East region. This activity will be held in each state and territory capital city and Townsville on Saturday, 21 March 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        The national commemoration for the completion of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Slipper" rel="nofollow">
         Operation Slipper
        </a>
        will recognise the commitment and sacrifice of all Australian personnel who have deployed as part of Australia's commitment to combat terrorism across Afghanistan and the Middle East. Operation Slipper has involved civilian and military members from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>

         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        and other government agencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also wish to update the parliament on the commencement of the ADF mission in Iraq, to assist the Iraqi government and the people of Iraq to combat the major threat posed by the brutal actions of ISIL, also known as Daesh. This is not a decision the government has taken lightly. Ultimately it is Iraq that must defeat ISIL, but it cannot be left to confront this horrendous movement alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is reluctant to reach out to conflicts thousands of miles away, but this conflict has reached out to us. At least 70 Australians are fighting with ISIL and other terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria, and another 100 or so supporting these extremists from inside Australia. This situation is as much a matter of domestic security as it is of international security. This trade is contribution is part of a broader coalition of over 60 nations that are operating in close collaboration with Iraq. This action has the support of regional nations across the Middle East and the wider international community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government's decision has the support of the

         Iraqi Security Forces
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        During my September visit to the Middle East, I was lucky enough to meet many talented and dedicated members of the deployed Australian Air Task Group and Special Operations Task Group and was impressed by the extreme skill and professionalism of these Australian Defence Force personnel. I was pleased to learn that 51 women have been deployed as part of our Air Task Group in a range of operational and support areas, including as watch keepers, air operations coordinators, intelligence analysts and legal and public affairs officers.
       </p>
       <p>
        As of 24 November 2014, our FA18
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Hornets" rel="nofollow">
         Super Hornets
        </a>
        had flown 64 missions in Iraq, each with two aircraft. The KC30A aircraft had flown 51 missions in Iraq, providing air-to-air refuelling support for Australian planes and other coalition aircraft. The E7A Wedgetail aircraft had flown 35 missions in Iraq, providing command and control and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support to coalition forces. On several occasions, Royal Australian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        personnel have taken the lead in planning and coordinating multinational air operations against ISIL targets in Iraq and achieved considerable success.
       </p>
       <p>
        In recent weeks an Australian FA18 Super Hornet identified a large, well-establish and hidden network of caves and bunkers occupied by ISIL in northern Iraq. Within days a subsequent multinational airstrike involving 20 aircraft attacked 44 targets, complimented by a large-scale ground operation led by the Kurdish Security Forces, and as such helped to clear this area of ISIL militants, with some reports indicating that over 100 Daesh fighters were killed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Coalition air operations are providing vital support to the Iraqi Security Forces' military campaign on the ground. This support has helped the Iraqi forces reclaim territory and key elements of national infrastructure previously held by ISIL, including the Bayji oil refinery in the country's north and the Fallujah dam, which provides critical water supplies across almost the whole of central Iraq. Crucially, our operations are providing time and space for Prime Minister Abadi to build an inclusive government and to regenerate the Iraqi Security Forces.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ADF mission in Iraq began with a clear humanitarian focus, and the plight of innocent civilians in Iraq remains central to all of our operations there. The ADF has conducted six humanitarian airdrop missions in northern Iraq to date to ease the terrible humanitarian situation imposed by ISIL forces on Iraqi civilians in the regions of Mount Sinjar and Amirli. The ADF has also conducted five military store supply missions to date, including arms and ammunition, as part of multinational efforts to equip the Kurdistan regional government to roll back ISIL. These stores are being used by Kurdish Peshmerga forces, which are operating in close conjunction with the Iraqi government security forces. Australia's objective in providing this support is to work with the Iraqi government to ensure it is able to keep its people safe, maintain reasonable control over its territory, and combat ISIL, or Daesh.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia stands firm as a responsible international partner who responds swiftly and effective to global security challenges. Our commitment to the mission in Afghanistan and our steadfast support for the international efforts against ISIL in Iraq signify Australia's firm intentions to deny terrorists safe havens to plan and train for attacks against civilians. We are not in this alone. In both Afghanistan and Iraq, Australia is a leading member of multinational coalitions who are working in close partnership with the host nations to defeat our mutual enemies.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to remember that both these missions involve risk to our ADF personnel. As they conduct these essential missions, our thoughts are with them, particularly at this time of the year. They are doing a simply wonderful job.

        I met with senior Australian, ISAF and Afghan commanders, and had an opportunity to address Australian troops serving in national and coalition appointments in Kabul.

        The Australian military and civilian contribution in Afghanistan is focused on the development of the ANSF through a regionally and nationally oriented training and advisory support mission as well as critical support areas such as force protection, advising, medical, and intelligence. In total, around 400 ADF personnel continue in these important roles.
       </p>

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia is committed to supporting security and stability in Afghanistan beyond 2014 through cooperation in security, diplomatic and development channels, and continuing to build the capacity of Afghanistan's national institutions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, our aid program will continue to build on and protect the gains of the last decade, supporting economic growth and governance, the empowerment of Afghan women and girls, and at-risk populations.

        Australia, along with the United States and our NATO partners, welcomed the swift signature by the Ghani Administration of the Bilateral Security Agreement with the United States and the NATO Status of Forces Agreement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia also welcomes the recent ratification of both agreements by Afghanistan's Parliament. These agreements provide the legal framework for the post-2014 mission, including for operational partners such as Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To consolidate and build on the security gains of the last 13 years, the ANSF and security ministries will still need continued training, advising and assisting particularly in key areas such as institutional development, aviation, special operations and intelligence. International assistance in financially sustaining its forces and operations will also be critical.

        ANSF Sustainment

        Financial support from the international community to assist Afghanistan with sustainment of its security forces is essential to Afghanistan's stability and security.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the September NATO Summit in Wales, the international community reaffirmed its 2012 Chicago Summit commitment to contribute to the financial sustainment of the ANSF from 2015 to 2017 and urged the wider international community to remain engaged in the financial sustainment of the ANSF.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This included a commitment to maintain and strengthen transparent, accountable and cost-effective funding mechanisms.
       </p>

        The funding will be directed towards the requirements of the ANSF such as training requirements, military education, and required infrastructure and equipment sustainment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia is a leading contributor to this important endeavour and has committed to provide US$100 million each year for three years from 2015 as part of the international contribution to help sustain and support the ANSF.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This will include US$80 million from Defence each year through the ANA Trust Fund. The remaining US$20 million each year will be from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

        This significant financial commitment has enabled Australia to take on a leadership role within the international donor community.

        We will continue this role in 2015 through our participation in the Oversight and Coordination Body and the ANA Trust Fund Board which provide oversight and coordination of international funding for ANSF sustainment.

       <p class="italic">
        International support for the financial sustainment is on the understanding that the Afghan Government will make an increasing financial contribution to this endeavour.

        End of OPERATION SLIPPER

        On 1 March 2014, Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced that Australia will have an Anzac Day style national commemoration for the war in Afghanistan, to ensure the bitter experience of returning Vietnam veterans is not repeated for those who have served in Australia's longest war.

        In line with broader transition efforts, the ANSF now lead detention operations across Afghanistan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Throughout our operations in Afghanistan, the Australian Government and the ADF have taken and continue to take their responsibilities to treat detainees humanely very seriously. We will continue to ensure we meet our ethical responsibilities and, where applicable, Australia's domestic and international legal obligations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of our detainee management framework, Australian officials and ADF personnel have monitored the treatment, welfare and conditions of all detainees transferred from ADF custody to Afghan (and previously US) custody. The remaining two ADF transferred detainees at the Afghan National Detention Facility-Parwan have been regularly monitored and no concerns have been identified with their treatment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since 1 August 2010, Australia has conducted over 160 separate visits to both Afghan and US detention facilities to monitor the welfare of ADF-transferred detainees. These visits included more than 2500 individual visit interviews and reports.

       <p class="italic">
        With transition to Afghan-led security, Australia will no longer conduct monitoring visits and will work with our Afghan and international partners to ensure the two remaining ADF-transferred detainees continue to be treated humanely in accordance with the applicable law.

Australia is one of more than 60 countries that are supporting the unity government in Iraq in their fight against ISIL.

On the ground we have around 200 special forces. They are now in Baghdad undertaking an important role advising and assisting the Iraqi army in their fight against ISIL. I am pleased that Defence have confirmed that appropriate force protection measures are in place.

          It is entirely appropriate, and the government have behaved very responsibly in ensuring, we did not rush headlong to try to get our troops deployed in Iraq. It is very important that all of the necessary documentation was provided, and we fully support the government taking the very precautionary approach they took in ensuring the safety of our troops and their legal protections. It would be entirely inappropriate for anything else to have happened, and the government has our full support.

          It is important that the Senate is given the opportunity to debate and discuss important issues. Minister Smith, before Minister Johnston, very much believed that this was the way to go. I know the Greens have a different view at times, but I know they will welcome the opportunity today to speak on these issues. While we may disagree, it is important that all in this chamber have an opportunity to express their view, put their case, argue their position. Ministerial statements provide us with that opportunity. I want to again express my support for the ADF personnel deployed around the world and to wish them and their families a happy and safe Christmas.
