        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Watt.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberals" rel="nofollow">
         The Liberals

        and Nationals said that low wages were a deliberate design feature of their economic strategy—and, sadly, it was the only strategy that they delivered. Now that Australians are feeling the crunch of cost-of-living rises and stagnant wages, can you outline the government's workplace relations policies, how they will actually help Australians deal with the cost of living and why this is actually important?

         Thank you, Senator Grogan. I would love nothing more than to explain how the government's workplace relations policies will help working people get ahead in life, because I think one thing most Australians can agree on is that the workplace relations system in our country is not working for workers or for employers. It's not delivering the fairness, the gender equality, the productivity gains or the economic growth that Australia needs.
        </p>
        <p>
         But the Albanese government's workplace bargaining policies will get wages moving again. That's something Australian workers desperately need after nearly 10 years of low wages under those who sit opposite and still haven't changed their ways. The fact that this was, in their own words, a deliberate design feature of the previous government's management of the economy is something we'll be reminded of for many years to come. This shows how little those opposite think of workers in this country, and their contributions to the public debate on our policies have shown that nothing has changed. It's the same old, same old from the Liberal and National parties in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Albanese government's package has been designed to lift the wages of Australian workers by putting job security and gender equality as objects of the Fair Work Act and by creating a pay equity expert panel and a care and community sector expert panel to, in particular, assist women and those working in the care economy. We'll also make flexible work arrangements much more accessible and prohibit pay secrecy clauses so people, in particular women, are free to talk about their pay at work. We'll place limits on the use of fixed-term employment contracts so people don't get stuck on endless probation. We'll sunset substandard
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
          Work Choices
         </a>
         -era zombie agreements. We'll ensure the agreement termination process is fit for purpose and fair. We'll ban job ads that pay less than the minimum wage. We'll make the better off overall test simple, flexible and fair. And we'll improve access to single- and multi-employer agreements because bargaining delivers for workers and businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you're serious about fixing the cost of living, you need to get wages moving for all Australians, and that's exactly what we'll do.

            I can, Senator Grogan, because we want to make more agreements that benefit both employers and workers. I understand that the concept of workers and businesses coming to agreements is something that the opposition just cannot get its head across, but actually it can be done. And, importantly, we want to stop the race to the bottom by those who undercut businesses who are genuinely trying to do the right thing by their workers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me give you one great example of businesses who are embracing this new era of workplace relations that will benefit workers and employers. As reported this morning in the
            <i>
             Financial Review
            </i>
            , the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning manufacturing and installation association has wasted no time starting their multi-employer bargaining. We hear the laughter and the scoffs from those on the other side that there might be employers who actually want to come to agreements. This group met the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMWU" rel="nofollow">
             AMWU
            </a>
            on Monday to discuss ways to use the new laws to deliver higher pay and standards for staff. This is what the Albanese Labor government wants to see more of—employers, unions and workers coming together to deliver a win-win.

               I can, because it is urgent that we get wages moving again. We understand from all of the public debate we've seen over the last few months, backing in the last 10 years of inaction and deliberate design features of economy being low wages, that for the opposition it's never the right time for workers to get a pay rise. It was never the right time during the 10 years they were in office, and it's not the right time now that they are in opposition.
              </p>
              <p>
               Well, we have had enough. Workers have had enough. It's time to get wages moving again. The best way to do this is by encouraging more agreements to be made and stop a race to the bottom on wages. It's good to see that Senator Colbeck has a little bit of fight left in him, because no-one else on the other side does. Australian workers have waited long enough, and, while waiting, they have turned up every day and done their job.
              </p>
              <p>
               See, Senator Colbeck, I knew you could be an example for your colleagues! Workers have been waiting. They've been turning up every day and doing their job. It's now time we did ours and legislated for secure jobs and better pay. Labor cares about working people. We care about giving them a pay rise so they can keep up with the rising—
