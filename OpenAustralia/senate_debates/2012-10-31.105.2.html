        , my question is to Senator Wong, the Minister representing the Treasurer. Can the minister confirm that, under Labor's special mining tax deal with the three biggest miners, the government will have to pay more than 10 per cent compound interest on any royalty credits which are accumulating while those miners do not pay any tax?

         An opposition senator: It is hardly a surprise.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator, you may be able to recall every aspect of every tax in detail, but I am not in a position to provide the particular detail which is being referred to. I am not sure if this was in the letter that I got some time ago. Maybe Senator Cormann can refer me to it. But, as I said to him at the time, it is still a question without notice. I am happy to take that on notice and see if I can provide any further details. Obviously the usual caveats would apply. We are not going to be disclosing the individual tax affairs of companies. That is obviously not appropriate for the government to do. I also make the more important point from the budget perspective that the design of the tax—

          , on a point of order: the minister has already said she is taking the question on notice. That is fair enough. If she does not know the answer, it is the appropriate thing for her to do. But having indicated to the chamber that she has taken the question on notice, anything more is gratuitous commentary that just uses up question time.

                    , I ask a supplementary question. I refer the minister to the 1½ pages of the minerals resource rent tax heads of agreement, signed by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Resources and Energy, and the three managing directors of three big mining companies which says:

                     We have had a number of discussions about royalties, and I have made clear in terms of the midyear update that the design of the

                      MRRT
                     </a>
                     has been reflected in the estimates for that revenue line item. I have also made clear that the announced royalty changes by the Queensland government have been taken into account in the updated MRRT estimate and that the decision by the

                     government to increase royalties has not been included because specific policy details are yet to be announced. If there is any further information I can provide the senator with, I will do so, but he is on the side of advocating—I think from what he is asking me—for royalties as a good tax but not a profits based tax which was a bad tax.

                      , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the minister is unaware how many royalty credits have been accumulated so far and how much compound interest on those royalty credits the government expects to accumulate, how can the government possibly estimate the net revenue it expects to collect from the mining tax over the forward estimates?

                       Senator, this was the answer I gave you in the first question which you clearly were not listening to. I made the point that, when Treasury considers and updates its estimates, it makes assumptions about how much revenue the tax will collect. It obviously applies the existing architecture of the tax and makes assumptions also about various other factors such as commodity prices and so forth
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The whole point of the answer I was giving you is that those factors have been taken into account in the revised
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRRT" rel="nofollow">
                        MRRT
                       </a>
                       estimates, which of course do reflect a write-down because—surprise, surprise—as the senator should know, being a senator from
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                        Western Australia
                       </a>
                       , commodity prices have come off significantly since the budget. When you are in a profit based tax regime, it is unsurprising that it will affect the revenue take.
