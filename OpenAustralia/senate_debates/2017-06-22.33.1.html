            The opposition believes the government should provide responses to the reports of Senate committee inquiries. Committee inquiries are a critical part of the work of the Senate. Government responses to committee reports are an important part of this process. Since 1978, successive governments have undertaken to respond to committee reports within a specified period, which is currently three months. It is not acceptable for any government to take over 18 months to respond to a Senate committee report. In supporting the important principle of governments providing responses to committee reports, the opposition is not making a judgement on the findings of the inquiry itself. Labor does not support Senator Hanson's view on halal food.

               I should remind the Senate that Senator Dastyari chaired this inquiry, which I initiated, and it was unanimously endorsed, as per the recommendations. It is all well and good for the Labor Party to distance themselves from the report now, but it was endorsed by their chairman. The second point I would like to make is that this report and the recommendations arising from it have actually travelled towards the cabinet. It was taken there by some people. In fact, the meat industry themselves were informed that there was a resolution on the books. But, unfortunately, this cabinet has squibbed it—they have squibbed finding a resolution and they have kicked it into the long grass. This is an indictment upon the process, because they are looking for certainty in the meat industry. It is about time they reported on it. It has been far too long, and I think Senator Hanson is quite right to bring it to the attention of this chamber again.

                 will not be supporting this motion. I think Senator Hanson and Senator Bernardi should worry less about the eating habits of other Australians and more about the needs of our children in schools. We heard some of the most hateful, outrageous and disgraceful comments towards young children in schools who need additional support. Senator Hanson thinks they should not get that support. We have a situation—

                  Regarding having children in schools who have special needs, it is not just important that those children are able to attend those schools; it is good for the other kids in the classroom, who learn that if we are in a civilised society where there is difference we should accept and celebrate that difference, because that is what makes us a decent society.

                                 indicate on behalf of my colleagues that we support this motion. The unanimous recommendations of the Senate committee were, I believe, uncontroversial. I support halal and, indeed, kosher certification of food. These recommendations were about greater transparency and clarity in certification. We think that the recommendations are uncontroversial and the government should respond accordingly.
