          Who's taking his questions? It's Senator Watt—I draw the lucky straw today! Right across the country, sacred sites, including on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwi_Islands" rel="nofollow">
           Tiwi Islands
          </a>
          and Murujuga in my home state of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          , are under threat from resources companies. These sites hold knowledge and stories that are tens of thousands of years old. Murujuga holds some of the most ancient rock art in the world, and much of it has been destroyed. The current pipeline of the Barossa project north of the Tiwi Islands will impact sacred burial sites and songlines, and, indeed, the first point of contact for humans on this continent. Minister, my question is: what is your government doing to protect
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           First Nations
          </a>
          cultural heritage, instead of trying to justify it for corporate profits, and what are you doing to protect our precious ecosystems and sacred places?

           Thank you, Senator Cox. I will do my best to represent Senator Farrell, who's representing Minister King. Obviously, this government takes the matters that you've raised very seriously. We absolutely respect
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
            First Nations
           </a>
           cultural heritage right across our country, and these are important matters that need to be considered in the context of any proposed resource development, whether it be in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory
           </a>
           or anywhere else. Senator Cox, you would be aware that the government does have a process underway around the amendments to and reconsideration of cultural heritage legislation. That matter actually is being led by Minister Plibersek, as I understand it. I'm happy to provide you with some further information about where that process is up to, but the point remains that we do need to get to a place in Australia where important cultural heritage sites for our First Nations people are respected.
          </p>
          <p>
           Obviously, our government does also support resource developments going ahead and other projects that create jobs and produce economic development, including for First Nations communities, but those projects need to proceed in a way that does respect First Nations cultural heritage. A lot of this debate has of course been prompted by the terrible scenes that we saw involving Juukan Gorge, which I think gave all Australians and resource companies some pause for thought about the interaction between those types of developments and projects and First Nations heritage. I'm happy to provide you with some further information on that as it comes to hand.

               Thank you, Senator Wong. I will direct my questions to you. The fact of the matter is that this government and successive governments have allowed, and continue to allow, sacred sites to be destroyed for the sake of the resources industry. Will this government step in and ensure that the resources industry are not allowed to destroy sacred sites, such as those on the

                We have a regulatory framework in place that is intended to assure the protection of Indigenous cultural heritage. However, Senator, you are right to point to the examples of particular companies not acting in accordance with that regulatory framework. The most egregious example of that is, of course, Juukan Gorge. I know a parliamentary committee did make very clear representations about the importance of strengthening Commonwealth cultural heritage protections following the destruction of Juukan Gorge. That was agreed. The minister has outlined a consultation process for that.

                   I welcome the community representatives and elders here today. We are aware of court proceedings in relation to the Barossa project. You would understand, Senator—just as I understand why you are asking me the question—that, as the matter remains before the courts, the government and in fact the Senate, as a general rule, will not be commenting on matters before the Federal Court. I would note that the federal government is not party to these proceedings.
