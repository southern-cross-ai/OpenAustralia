        My question is to the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield: Is the minister aware that Caboolture, in the electorate of Longman, has been rated as having the highest number of complaints about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN

        from homes and businesses in Queensland? Can the minister confirm that complaints about the NBN alone increased by 204 per cent in 2017?

         I thank Senator Watt for his question. The

          NBN
         </a>
         , in contrast to the record of those opposite, is actually being delivered. When those opposite were on the Treasury benches, the NBN was a fantasy. Only 51,000 premises had been connected to the NBN nationwide, despite billions having been spent over four or five years. I am very pleased to advise the chamber that the NBN is now available to more than half the country. It is on track to be completed by 2020, which is a good six to eight years sooner than was proposed by those opposite, and at about $30 billion less cost.

           On relevance. I have been letting the minister go for some time but he hasn't addressed the point of the question. The question was whether the minister was aware that Caboolture in Longman has been rated as having the highest number of complaints and it asked the minister to confirm that complaints about the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

           alone have increased by more than double. He hasn't come to that yet.

             As I was saying, with a project of this scale, where you are, effectively, transferring the entire nation to a new network, there will be individuals and businesses who will have an experience that isn't all that we would hope it would be. And I would never seek to diminish the experience of an individual or a household that isn't all that it should be. We have been putting in place a range of measures to enhance the consumer experience and provide greater transparency to consumers. For instance, we have tasked the

             with the monitoring of services. They are embedding 4,000 probes in premises around the nation so that individuals will be able to see what the service is that retailers are providing in a particular area.

                    is one part of the broadband supply chain. The broadband supply chain consists of NBN as the wholesaler. It consists of the retailers who provide the service to the households. Also, there are content providers. Optus is a content provider and is, perhaps, a conspicuous example.
