        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Can the minister please inform the Senate about food security in Australia and abroad? Can the minister also update the Senate about the Gillard government's National Food Plan?

         I thank Senator Furner for his continuing interest in food security and the National Food Plan. The government understands that for farmers, producers, food producing regions and consumers the question of food security and the future of our food industry is a critical one. In Australia, food production supports jobs, underpins regional development and provides the entire community with high-quality food and fibre. Australia's food industry significantly contributes to the economy and trade and all parts of the food chain. This industry contributes over $200 billion to the Australian economy. Food and related employment right along the supply chain is estimated to be nearly one million people, or to put it another way: roughly one in 22 Australians work in the food chain. At home, it is fair to say that Australians have an enviable food security status and we will, as a government, continue to defend and ensure that this status continues and that it plays an important role in the provision of global food security.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the world is changing rapidly and Australia needs to be ready to meet the risks and opportunities as they occur, including a changing global food market, global population growth and climate change. It is for these reasons that last year the Gillard government made a commitment to look into the future and to develop the nation's first ever National Food Plan. The government has a clear vision for Australia's food supply chains. We want to foster a sustainable, global, competitive, resilient food supply and we want to ensure that food supply supports every Australian's access to nutritious and affordable food. I am able to inform the Senate that the finalised objectives of the National Food Plan include identifying and mitigating risks to our food security, reducing the barriers—

           I thank Senator Furner for his first supplementary question. The National Food Plan will provide us with a strategic road map to deliver for the food supply chain throughout Australia. I can inform the Senate that the Gillard government has announced that it will now develop Australia's first National Food Plan through a green paper-white paper process, creating a National Food Plan white paper. This sends a clear message to industry and to the community of the importance and seriousness of food related issues in the economy and our society. A white paper demonstrates that the Gillard government has a genuine commitment to this critical area of future policy development. Overall, the green paper-white paper process will ensure that our first National Flood Plan continues to have whole-of-government support and the attention that the issue requires. It will provide a significant strategic policy statement that acts as a platform for better outcomes for our food sector and Australian consumers now and into the future.

             would be interested to know, notwithstanding those opposite, that this National Food Plan is the first of its type in this nation. The Gillard government is actively engaging and seriously developing a strategic road map to achieve a clear vision in food and food supply in this country. This is for the benefit of farmers, consumers, industry and the wider region. I would encourage those opposite to have a good look at the road map and to develop, support and encourage it into the future for the development of a National Food Plan. Those opposite have a penchant for saying no to everything, but in this instance I would encourage them to come on board with farmers, consumers and the wider Australian public and to join in the process of developing the first National Food Plan.
