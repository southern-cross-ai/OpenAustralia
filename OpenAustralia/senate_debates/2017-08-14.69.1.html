        My question is to the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield. The chief operating officer of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPG" rel="nofollow">
         TPG
        </a>
        recently said, 'With fibre to the node, we're not even allowed to lodge a fault with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        unless the line performs less than 12 megabits per second.' Does the minister consider this practice to be fair to consumers, or is this simply what Australians should expect on the second-rate copper NBN?

           . I'm aware that the senator is only shortly into his time, but this is a speaking point that we've heard on multiple occasions. It's not related to my question in any way, which asked the minister to consider the practice of retail service providers lodging a fault with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN
           </a>
           and them being unable to do so unless it's less than 12 megabits per second. The question goes to: is this practice fair to consumers, or is it simply what Australians should expect of a second-rate copper NBN? We don't need to hear the minister's speaking notes again, thanks.

             . As I was saying, it's precisely because of the multitechnology mix approach adopted by this government that the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
              NBN
             </a>
             will be completed six to eight years sooner than would otherwise have been the case, and at about $30 billion less cost.
            </p>
            <p>
             The senator is quite right: part of the multitechnology mix is the deployment of the fibre to the node. Now, if colleagues will look around the world, it is extremely common that a multitechnology approach is taken around the world because it's recognised that you've got to deploy the technology that makes sense in a given area. If it makes sense, for instance, to use the existing
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFC" rel="nofollow">
              HFC

              TV
             </a>
             cable, then use that. If it makes sense to deploy what we're calling fibre to the curb, then that should happen. If fibre to the node makes sense, do that; if fixed wireless makes sense, do that; and if the use of satellite is what is most sensible in a given area, then that should be used.
            </p>
            <p>
             That is the approach that we're taking, and of course—

                   refuses to investigate problems where the line speed is not below 12 megabits per second, what advice does the minister have for Australians on the copper NBN, who are paying for 50 megabits per second but can only receive a maximum of 14 megabits per second?

                    I think, as colleagues here would know, there can be a range of reasons why a consumer is receiving speeds lower than they expect. It can be the case of the in-house wiring. It can be the case of the modem that the individual has. It can be a function of the amount of capacity that a retailer purchases. What I encourage all consumers to do, if they are not satisfied with the service they are receiving, is contact their retail service provider. If they're still not satisfied, they should contact the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.

                    We think it's very important that there is transparency about what is happening with the

                    . That's why we've charged the

                    to deploy 4,000 probes in premises around the nation, so that there will be visibility in terms of the speeds that retailers are providing.

                       As I was just starting to outline, where consumers believe that their retailer has not provisioned their service as it should, that is a significant matter, and that's an area where we expect the

                       to investigate. I have written to the ACCC asking them to investigate such cases. The ACCC has issued six principles to retailers to guide their advertising. The ACCC will shortly be providing further guidance to retailers. But, as I say, this is an area where we want transparency. That's why I asked the
