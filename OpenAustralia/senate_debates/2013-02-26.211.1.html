         The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) (a) The employee shortfall in the Tourism and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality_Industry" rel="nofollow">
          Hospitality Industry
         </a>
         is driven by a complex mix of factors, including fluctuating demand (due to seasonal change and economic conditions), high job turnover, low retention and casualisation of the workforce.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Department_of_Education" rel="nofollow">
          The Department of Education
         </a>
         , Employment and Workplace Relations (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEEWR" rel="nofollow">
          DEEWR
         </a>
         ) provides assistance to employers to meet their labour needs via
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Services_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Job Services Australia
         </a>
         and the Seasonal Worker Program. On top of this, DEEWR has a range of labour market strategies focused on better connecting job seekers with jobs in specific industries and/​or regions. One example of this related to the tourism industry is DEEWR funding the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Hotels_Association" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Hotels Association
         </a>
         and Restaurant and Catering Australia to act as Employer Brokers, working in association with Job Services Australia and large employers in the Tourism and Hospitality Industry to address labour shortfalls through recruitment of jobseekers.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         While the Employer Broker program has now ended, success is evident in improved engagement between large hotel chains and Job Services Australia providers in facilitating recuitment for entry level jobs. Facilitating recruitment for highly-skilled and challenging occupations such as chefs is more difficult. The Department is currently working with the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism and industry representatives to support more effective workforce strategies for cooks and chefs. The Department's focus is on facilitating effective recruitment and career development strategies for both employers and jobseekers.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Under the Seasonal Worker Program, up to 12,000 places are available to Australian employers. There are 10,450 places available for the Australian horticulture sector over a four year period and 1,550 places for a trial of seasonal labour mobility arrangements in certain regions with Australia's accommodation, aquaculture, cane and cotton sectors over a three year period.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In order to participate in the Seasonal Worker Program, an interested business must complete:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         In addition, approved businesses must complete a recruitment plan and submit to DEEWR for assessment prior to recruiting seasonal workers.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) (a) The total budget for the 'hot spot' Tourism Employment Plans is $1.1 million.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) The Tourism Employment Plans involve a four stage process of regional consultation, mapping and gapping of existing programs, development of immediate and medium term labour and skills solutions tailored to the needs of the area and development of a sustainable model to carry the Plan forward.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) Individual key performance indicators and metrics are developed in consultation with each region as part of the final Tourism Employment Plan.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Through the National Workforce Development Fund the government is providing over $8.3 million and industry is providing $3.7 million for the Workforce Futures project that will support workforce development and training in the sector. This includes $2.4 million in government funding and $2.2 in industry funding for targeted skills development. The project has commenced, and is due to be completed by 30 June 2015.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The key deliverable of the Career Promotional Campaign project is the development of a toolkit that comprises a package of materials that promotes tourism and hospitality career pathways for careers in high demand occupations and regions. The campaign is complementary to existing resources including Discover Tourism and Discover Hospitality. The package of materials is being developed by the National Tourism Alliance and are scheduled to be publicly available in February 2013.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) The Seasonal Worker Program is not open to all types of tourism businesses. The three year trial of seasonal labour mobility arrangements is limited to accommodation providers in selected locations (corresponding to the Tourism Employment Plan 'hot spots'), including Broome in

        </p>

          The Pilot

        <p class="italic">
         (c) Of the 2500 visas available under the Pilot, a total of 1633 visas were granted, predominantly in the final year due to alleviation of climatic conditions such as drought, and improvement in the economy after the global financial crisis.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Under the Seasonal Worker Program, up to 12,000 places are available to Australian employers.
