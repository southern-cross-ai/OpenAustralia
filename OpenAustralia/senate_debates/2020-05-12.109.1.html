        AMENDMENT (EMERGENCY LEAVE PROVISION) BILL

       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of this Bill to introduce a new emergency leave provision into the
        <i>
         Aged Care Act 1997
        </i>
        (the Act), which will allow permanent residential aged care residents to take emergency leave above their current annual allocation of 52 days leave. The leave provision will be activated in situations such as pandemics, natural disasters or other extraordinary emergencies as determined by either the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians or the Secretary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health
        </a>
        . It is proposed that the emergency leave provision will be will be applied retrospectively to 1 April 2020, to ensure coverage for residents already impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aged_care" rel="nofollow">
         Aged care
        </a>
        residents are entitled to take up to 52 days of non-hospital related leave (commonly known as social leave) within a financial year. At present, when an aged care resident exceeds their annual social leave entitlement, the aged care home no longer receives
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        residential care subsidy for that person, and the provider is able to pass those costs onto the resident.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic a number of permanent residential aged care residents have temporarily relocated with family to reduce their risk of exposure to the virus. Residents are able to use their social leave entitlements for this purpose, however, if they take this option they would exhaust their leave entitlement before the end of the pandemic. The additional costs the resident would be expected to pay to remain on leave, and still retain their place at the aged care home, would result in a significant financial burden on them or their families.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To address this issue, the Government is seeking to amend the Act to introduce an emergency leave provision that can be utilized by permanent residential aged care residents. This will be through an emergency leave type (covering such things as natural disasters, pandemics or other emergencies impacting the safe provision of residential aged care.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage within this sitting will ensure that permanent residential aged care residents and their families are supported to make decisions about personal safety in emergency situations, and not suffer unnecessary financial burden during emergencies. It will also ensure that residential aged care providers are not financially disadvantaged.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These legislative amendments are a way to this address this issue, both with the current COVID-19 pandemic and future emergency situations, and it is therefore important to progress these changes urgently to ensure residents and their families are appropriately supported.

        Passage of the bill in the 2020 Winter sittings is required to ensure the lack of legislative authority to certify legitimate exports of narcotic goods, such as medicinal cannabis and hemp product exports, from Australia is resolved as soon as possible. Passage will enable the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        , Water and the Environment (the Department), which houses Australia's National Plant Protection Organisation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Plant_Protection_Convention" rel="nofollow">
         International Plant Protection Convention
        </a>
        , to bust congestion and immediately issue government certificates, such as phytosanitary (plant health) certificates, for legitimate exports of narcotic goods from Australia. Certification like this is required to accompany export consignments to satisfy the import requirements of overseas countries. The Department already provides similar certification for a range of other agricultural goods already regulated under the Export Control Acts.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the absence of legislative authority to issue certification, the Department negotiates with overseas countries for acceptance of alternative ways to provide regulatory assurance on the nature, condition, or status of narcotic consignments. These negotiations and arrangements lead to lengthy delays or, where a request is rejected by an overseas country, a critical barrier to the legitimate export of narcotic goods from Australia. Recently, one such request relating to an export consignment of low-tetrahydrocannabinol (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THC" rel="nofollow">
         THC
        </a>
        ) hemp seeds was refused by an overseas trading partner.

         Home Affairs
        </a>
        and the Office of Drug Control, in the Department of Health. The bill ensures that Australia's reputation as a supplier of high quality, clean and green agriculture exports is supported, without undermining or duplicating the important regulatory function performed by the Office of Drug Control and the Department of Home Affairs. Both agencies have endorsed the solution to the existing regulatory barrier.
