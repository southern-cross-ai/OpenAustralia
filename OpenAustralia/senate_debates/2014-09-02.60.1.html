        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Senator Fifield. There were reports today that the government is considering reducing the waiting time for the young job seekers to access income support on the earn-and-learn measures—suggesting that they are reducing it to one month rather than six months. Is this correct? What period of time is the government considering, if they are considering reducing the amount of time? Has the government got the Palmer United Party's agreement to these changes?

         I thank Senator Siewert for her question. As colleagues would be well aware, in the budget we had a number of measures which were announced in an effort to help Australians who are unemployed, particularly young unemployed Australians, into work. We are, as with all budget measures, endeavouring to secure their passage through the parliament. I understand that obviously there will be speculation from time to time about particular budget measures, but all I can say to you, Senator Siewert, is that we are working to secure the passage of our budget measures through the parliament.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Does that mean that the government is not considering reducing the cruel and harsh six-month waiting period in which people will have no income support? Does that mean the government is not at all considering reducing that waiting period?

           All I can really do is restate to colleagues what the budget measures were. Namely, from 1 January 2015 young unemployed people aged 22 to 24 will no longer be eligible for Newstart or sickness allowance. Instead, they will be eligible for youth allowance (student) or youth allowance (other) until they turn 25 years of age. Also from 1 January 2015 all new job seekers up to 30 years of age claiming Newstart and youth allowance (other) will be subject to a six-month waiting period during which time the job seeker must demonstrate appropriate job search activities and must participate in employment support services. After the six-month waiting period, job seekers would be eligible to receive income support for six months subject to participation in 25 hours per week of Work for the Dole. Job seekers will receive income support for six months in every 12-month period. That is what was announced at the budget and that is our policy.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. What evidence does the government have that putting people on no income support for any period of time, let alone six months, supports them into work, particularly given that the government has oft cited

             I think it is important, in the context of Senator Siewert's question, to point out that there are a number of exceptions to what the government has announced: if an individual has a partial capacity to work less than 30 hours per week, if they are in full—

I think they are important exemptions for people to be aware of. But I can assure Senator Siewert and all colleagues that every policy that we have announced, particularly our budget measures, is focused around doing what we can to help create an environment that is conducive to and supportive—
