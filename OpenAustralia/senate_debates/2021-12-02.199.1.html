        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Colbeck. Senator Gerard Rennick has said of the Pfizer vaccine: 'When are these snake-oil salesmen going to be called out? The Pfizer shot doesn't deserve to be called a vaccine.' When asked during Senate estimates what action this minister would take in response, he assured the committee: 'I'm happy to follow up personally with my colleague.' Has the minister personally spoken with Senator Rennick about these comments? If so, when, and what did he say?

         I have had conversations with Senator Rennick about the efficacy of vaccines on a number of occasions, because the data is very, very clear: the vaccines are safe and they work. It's that information that I put to Senator Rennick. I am firmly of the belief, because I look at the information every day and I read the data every day, that the vaccines are effective. The data demonstrates that.

        </p>
        <p>
         That's exactly right, Senator; I look at the data every day, because it's important that we understand that is the case. It shows in the data in fact that last year, without a vaccine, seven per cent of cases in this country were in aged care, but this year, with the workforce vaccinated and the residents of aged care vaccinated, the number of cases that are in aged care is 0.7 per cent. That is 10 times less the number of people in aged care as a proportion of cases this year compared to last year. So the data is very clear.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those are the points I put to Senator Rennick, because I want him to understand what I know from looking at the data. The vaccines we have for Australians are not only safe but effective. I will at every opportunity continue to repeat that message, not only for people like Senator Rennick, who has some questions, but for other Australians, to convince all Australians that they ought to take up the opportunity for a vaccine. Over 92 per cent of Australians have now had a first dose and approaching 87 per cent have had a second dose. That's a great result. I congratulate Australians for going out and getting vaccinated.

           Senator Rennick has also set up a taxpayer funded website undermining COVID-19 vaccines, which Australian Medical Association Vice President Chris Moy has described as 'conspiracy theory push polling. It's about an antiscientific as you can get'. Does the minister agree?

            I agree with Dr Moy. We want to ensure that the information that is provided to Australians with respect to vaccines is factual. We as a government, and particularly as ministers in the government, continue to look at the data. The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_Goods_Administration" rel="nofollow">
             Therapeutic Goods Administration
            </a>
            continue to assess the data on vaccines globally so they can make sure the appropriate decisions are made, and so do ATAGI. They continue to look at the data and the information on vaccines so they can provide the appropriate advice to Australians with respect to vaccination.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would urge all Australians not to look at what's on Facebook, not to look at what's on those sorts of sites, but to look at the ATAGI site, look at the TGA site and look at the

              Given Senator Rennick has continued to post content on social media which he has admitted 'may not be 100 per cent right', will the minister publicly condemn Senator Rennick's use of taxpayer funds to spread vaccine disinformation and conspiracies?

               I've urged Senator Rennick to ensure that the information on his website is factual and true. I acknowledge that he has admitted that it isn't. But one of the really important jobs that we all have here in this place is to give a voice to our constituents. That's one of the things that we do. It's a really important thing we do. But, in the circumstance of an issue that is as important as this, it is our responsibility to ensure that the information we are sharing—and the voices that we are giving elevation to by virtue of the fact that we are public figures and have a platform to be able to do that—is true. I have had that conversation with Senator Rennick, because it's a principle that I believe is extremely important. We want to make sure that Australians get access to information and that it's true. We want them to get vaccinated and we want them to understand that the vaccines that we have in this country are safe and that they work. (
