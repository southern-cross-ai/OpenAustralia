        My question is to the Minister representing the Deputy Prime Minister, Senator Nash. Today Deputy Prime Minister Joyce claimed that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Electricity" rel="nofollow">
         Delta Electricity
        </a>
        had 'put an expression of interest out today in the purchase of Liddell'. Delta Company Secretary
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Gurney" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Gurney
        </a>
        has said that the company has not lodged an expression of interest and said: 'Liddell is not for sale—it is not on the market.' Who is right?

         I'm not aware of those specific comments, but I can certainly advise the Senate that there have been very constructive discussions between the government and the owners of Liddell about ensuring the future provision of energy in this country. It is of no surprise to those on this side of the chamber that it is the coalition government that is working tirelessly to ensure that we provide affordable and reliable energy for Australians right across the country. Those on the other side simply will not focus on that issue. We on this side of the chamber, the coalition, recognise that, when it comes to the provision of reliable and affordable energy, it is an all-of-the-above policy. That includes coal and all of the other options.

            Delta Electricity
           </a>

            To the contrary. Your question was: who was correct? The minister said she was not aware of the comments. So the minister has indicated that she can't answer that question from that perspective. Minister.

             . It is entirely appropriate that this government consider options for extending the provision of energy from coal into the future as part of that all-of-the-above energy mix. It is those on this side of the chamber, the coalition, not those opposite, who actually care about people across this country being able to access affordable and reliable energy. We will keep making decisions to ensure that that happens. And all credit to the Prime Minister when we look at
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Hydro" rel="nofollow">
              Snowy Hydro
             </a>
             2.0, looking at long-term provision of energy right across this country to people out in our communities, who need a government to be focused on this, and the coalition certainly is. There have been discussions with the retailers about ensuring that consumers right across this country can have access to energy at the most affordable level. Around two million Australians will be able to benefit from those discussions and what was arrived at in those conversations. It is the coalition that is going to ensure that we deliver reliable and affordable energy.

                I completely reject that. This government is taking sensible, measured decisions to ensure the provision of affordable and reliable energy—in direct contrast to the Labor Party. You only have to look at
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                 South Australia

                and the Labor government in South Australia and the mess we have seen down there, for people living right across that state, with the lack of ability to provide any kind of reliable energy. It is the coalition that is going to continue to work hard to ensure that we provide for the Australian people the reliable and affordable energy that they deserve.
