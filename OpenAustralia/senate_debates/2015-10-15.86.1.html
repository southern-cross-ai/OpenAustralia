        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. I refer to paragraph 2.5 of the
        <i>
         Commonwealth Government Business Enterprise Governance and Oversight Guidelines
        </i>
        , which requires
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBE" rel="nofollow">
         GBE
        </a>
        s to 'avoid activities that could give rise to questions about their political impartiality'. Can the minister advise the Senate how the request by this minister and the former Minister for Communications for nbn co to include a distorted counterfactual of Labor's

         I thank Senator Singh for that question. I completely reject the premise of the question. We did not ask nbn co to assess a distorted version of Labor policy. As part of prudent, good and effective government we asked them to assess various alternative ways of delivering the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN

           I have essentially dealt with the substantive part of that question in my answer to the first question. Of course, Senator Fifield very eloquently answered the substantive part of that question in his answers. I might again say to Senator Singh—

              There is no point of order, Senator Wong. The question was, could the minister advise the Senate in relation to a request made. In a previous answer he has refuted that that request was made, and he again rejected the premise of the question.

                   Firstly, there is no conspiracy. Secondly, Senator Singh talks about

                   cost blow-outs. When Labor first announced their NBN policy it was going to cost $4.7 billion. That was in 2007. That went up to $42 billion in 2009, and we were heading for $100 billion under Labor's discredited approach. You were wasting taxpayers' money because you did not know what you were doing. In the time of the previous Labor government Senator Conroy travelled to Darwin five times, essentially to switch on five connections. He did one trip to Darwin for every connection of the new NBN. This was the sort of disrespect that Labor showed for taxpayers' money. We are doing it in a different way. We are making sure that this project is delivered on time, on budget and according to our priorities, and we are delivering it faster and more cheaply and more affordably for consumers than Labor ever would have.
