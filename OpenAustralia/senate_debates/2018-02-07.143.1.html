           This motion is an unwarranted attack on a distinguished military leader, for which the Greens should be ashamed.

           personnel conduct themselves to the highest standards, in accordance with strict rules of engagement, designed to protect our forces and minimise civil injury, and act in accordance with domestic and international law. The Iraqi and coalition offensive to liberate Fallujah, in late 2004, was a tough, complex and hard-fought battle. The circumstances in which Australia committed forces to the coalition effort in Iraq are a matter of public record and have been subject to parliamentary inquiry. The Australian Defence Force operates under strict rules of engagement in accordance with domestic and international law.

              The opposition will not be supporting this motion. The opposition does not support an inquiry into Australia's involvement in the

               Iraq War
              </a>
              . We've been clear about our position on the material shared by Senator Molan on social media. There is no excuse for propagating racist, bigoted posts from white supremacist organisation Britain First or any other organisation. The Prime Minister must break his silence, show some leadership and call on Senator Molan to apologise for his actions. However, the actions by the

              in seeking to make baseless allegations against the senator through a notice of motion are nothing more than a self-serving stunt. The opposition will not be any party to a motion that trivialises serious issues in order for the Greens to score cheap political points.

                 If Senator McGrath were so sure of his position, then why on earth would he not support an inquiry to confirm that position? If he were so sure of his position that the invasion of Iraq was not a political, strategic and humanitarian catastrophe—if he were absolutely sure that the invasion of Iraq was warranted—then he would be happy to support an inquiry so that we can learn the lessons of the past.

                 Just today we learnt that Senator Molan has posted more offensive material. This time it appears that he shared an offensive joke, and I'm not going to repeat it. How many more times do we need to be aware of this behaviour before he is rebuked by the Prime Minister? As I said yesterday, we saw the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
