        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Today, the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        confirmed that 80 asylum seekers being held in immigration detention were released almost immediately following last week's High Court ruling. The minister has said there will be strict conditions attached to the new visas that have been issued. What are these conditions, and what are the consequences for an individual who violates these visa conditions?

        <p>
         Thank you, Senator Cash. As I said yesterday and as we said last week, we will use all available powers to keep the community safe, and the government will also consider all legislative and regulatory options. As you would know, Senator Cash, through you, President, last week the High Court handed down a decision which required the release of an individual from immigration detention. Whilst the Commonwealth argued against this, obviously, the High Court has made a different decision. We have prepared for this outcome, given the case's significance, and community safety is the No. 1 priority throughout this process.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can advise the chamber that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         and Australian Border Force are working closely with state and territory authorities and that a joint operation was established on Friday. I am also advised that visas were issued to impacted individuals with strong mandatory conditions to ensure community safety is upheld. I would again emphasise that, as a decision of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          High Court of Australia
         </a>
         , the government is bound to implement it.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was asked about conditions. I'm advised that these include, for example, requirements to report regularly to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Home Affairs
         </a>
         and to inform the minister of changes to personal details, including address and social media profiles, restrictions on industries of employment and a range of other strict conditions. The government will continue to consider all measures that may be available to strengthen the protection of the community in this case.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also can indicate that a number of other people, around 90, have so far been assessed as being in similar circumstances to the original plaintiff.

              Agreed. It is a 20-year precedent. She would be aware of some of the offences of those who are in this position. Again, as I say, the government do not have a choice as to whether or not we release these individuals. These individuals are required to be released as a consequence of the
