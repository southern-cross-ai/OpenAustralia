           I'm pleased to draw the attention of colleagues to the fact that today is Safer Internet Day, which is a global event across 130 countries. This year's theme is 'Create, connect and share respect: a better internet starts with you'. I think the collective message of all colleagues today is that we want to see online a culture of respect. We want to see online the principle that you do unto others as you would have others do unto you and to see that the ordinary rules of human engagement which apply in our face-to-face dealings should also apply online. All colleagues would be well aware that technology has made us more productive. It's made us more connective and it's even, arguably at times, made us more entertained. But when we have new opportunities, such as this, it also means that there are new challenges. The message that I think is important for us collectively to put is that Australia is well placed when it comes to enhancing online safety.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government, when elected, established the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner. Over time, that role has expanded to particularly focus on women and domestic violence and the community more broadly, which is why we changed the name and the focus of the organisation to the Office of the eSafety Commissioner. We also have in place a world first: a legislated anti-cyberbullying regime aimed at young people. What this does is give the eSafety Commissioner the legislative power to direct social media organisations to take down offending material.

             I thank the minister for that answer. I wonder if the minister can further outline how the eSafety Commissioner is assisting, in particular, young Australians facing cyberbullying?

              As I was adverting to, the eSafety Commissioner has the power to issue a notice to a large social media organisation requiring them to remove material. It also has the power to issue a notice to a person who posted the material—what's called an end-user notice—requiring the person to remove the material and refrain from posting the material or apologise for posting the material. The eSafety Commissioner also has the capacity to levy fines. I'm pleased to report that thus far the eSafety Commissioner has had 100 per cent success in having offending material pulled down, in terms of cyberbullying. I should acknowledge the cooperation of social media organisations on that front. The commissioner also has the Young and eSafe youth platform, which provides lesson plans to help equip young people. It has virtual classrooms for students and professional development programs to assist educators.

                 The government has before the parliament important legislation to introduce a civil penalties regime for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. This will be in parallel to the existing criminal provisions at Commonwealth level and at state level. As a government—and I'm sure I speak on behalf of all colleagues here—wherever there is more that we can do, we want to do that. We should acknowledge the importance of education and the role of non-government organisations, schools, parents and families, but I should also draw the attention of colleagues to the fact that there is a statutory review of the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015 and the operation of the eSafety Office which will be conducted by July 2018. It is envisaged that this review will seek the views of relevant stakeholders to see what more we can and should do.
