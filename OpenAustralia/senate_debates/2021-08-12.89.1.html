       <p class="italic">
        Australia has implemented a best practice donation system and is a leader in organ transplantation. Since the commencement of the Australian Government's national program to increase organ and tissue donation for transplantation in 2009, there has been a trend of significant growth in donation rates with more than 14,000 Australians receiving a lifesaving organ transplant..

       <p class="italic">
        For someone who is seriously ill, an organ or tissue transplant can mean the difference between life and death, being healthy or sick; between seeing or being blind; or between being active and never walking again.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplantation" rel="nofollow">

        donation gives someone who has organ failure a second chance at life.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Few people have the opportunity to become an organ donor. An individual needs to die in a hospital, with organs functioning well, to be a donor. Only around two per cent of people who die in a hospital are able to be considered for organ donation. That's only around 1,300 people a year.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        ) is a member of the Board and is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the organisation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Board was established on 1 July 2017 following a review of the implementation of the national reform agenda on organ and tissue donation and transplantation conducted by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_and_Young" rel="nofollow">
         Ernst and Young
        </a>
        in 2016. Following the review, legislative changes established the Board as the accountable authority of the Organ and Tissue Authority under the PGPA Act
        <i>
         .
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This resulted in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTA" rel="nofollow">
         OTA
        </a>
        becoming the first non-corporate Commonwealth entity to have a Governance Board as the Accountable Authority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In July 2020, the Organ and Tissue Authority Governance Board undertook an internal review as required under the Board Charter. The results indicated a clear consensus from Board members of the need for increased time and capacity to contribute to the organisation's strategic direction and to provide advice and support to the CEO.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Bill
        </a>
        will transition the role of accountable authority from the Board back to the CEO, and replace the existing Governance Board with an Advisory Board under the
        <i>
         Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority Act 2008
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These governance changes will align the Organ and Tissue Authority with the governance structures of most other non-corporate Commonwealth entities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will amend the functions of the CEO to include all functions of accountable authority under the PGPA Act and establish the Advisory Board to provide advice and expertise to the CEO on organ and tissue donation and transplantation matters. There are no changes to the existing functions of the Organ and Tissue Authority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Advisory Board will have skills-based membership, harnessing expertise, experience and knowledge from a broad range of areas from within the organ and tissue sector including:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        All Advisory Board members, except the Chair, will be appointed by the Minister responsible for organ and tissue donation and transplantation matters, in consultation with the jurisdictions.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chair" rel="nofollow">
         The Chair
        </a>
        will be appointed directly by the responsible Minister.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These changes to the governance structure of the Organ and Tissue Authority will allow the Board a greater strategic focus to provide expertise and advice to the work of the Organ and Tissue Authority. This will support the Organ and Tissue Authority to set the priorities for the future to improve organ and tissue donation, retrieval and transplantation outcomes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like to acknowledge the valuable work of the Organ and Tissue Authority Board since its establishment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The transition of governance from the Board to the CEO will better support the Authority to more effectively achieve its strategic goals – saving lives, and improving the quality of life, for more Australians.

        I move:
