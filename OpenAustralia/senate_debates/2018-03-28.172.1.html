        response to the Senate Economics References Committee report: Out of reach? The Australian housing affordability challenge

       <p class="italic">
        Background
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 12 December 2013, the Senate referred an inquiry into affordable housing to the Senate Economics References Committee for inquiry and report by 26 June 2014.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following extensive consultations and consideration of over 230 submissions, the Inquiry delivered its final report on 8 May 2015.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The final report,
        <i>
         Out of reach? The Australian housing affordability challenge,
        </i>
        provides 40 wide-ranging recommendations directed primarily toward improving home purchase affordability.

         The Committee
        </a>
        's report represents an extensive discussion of Australia's housing affordability issues and the related policy challenges faced by all levels of government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The comprehensive nature of the report reflects the high quality of submissions received and evidence given at Inquiry hearings by individuals and organisations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee's recommendations canvassed a range of changes to Commonwealth and State and Territory taxation arrangements; improving the efficiency, effectiveness and equity of infrastructure funding arrangements; land supply, urban planning and zoning processes.
       </p>

        ' s response to the Affordable Housing Inquiry
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government's response to the Inquiry takes into account the outcomes from a range of housing processes that took place in 2015-16, including the Financial System Inquiry, the Competition Policy Review, the Review of Australia's Welfare System, and the House of Representatives' Inquiries into Foreign Investment into Residential Real Estate and Home Ownership.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This response encompasses a range of measures and actions the Government has introduced since the report was tabled in May 2015, including the Council on Federal Financial Relations Housing Supply Working Group and Affordable Housing Working Group, City Deals and most recently the Government's comprehensive housing affordability plan, announced in the 2017-18 Budget.

       <p class="italic">
        The Government will improve housing outcomes for Australians through:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        unlocking housing supply,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        creating the right incentives, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        improving outcomes for those most in need.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government's housing affordability plan intends to make more homes available for Australians by collaborating across all levels of government to increase the supply of housing. The plan will improve outcomes across the housing spectrum, from first home buyers through to Australians in need of affordable rental housing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For the first time, homelessness funding has been made ongoing and is indexed, giving certainty to providers of homelessness services.

        1. Unlocking supply
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will help boost the supply of housing and encourage a more responsive housing market by:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        establishing a $1 billion National Housing Infrastructure Facility to address infrastructure chokepoints that are impeding housing development in critical areas of undersupply,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        releasing surplus Commonwealth land, starting with a 127 hectare site in Maribyrnong Victoria, which will support up to 6,000 new homes, and

        2. Creating the right incentives
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is taking prudent steps to ensure incentives are better aligned with improving outcomes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This includes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        assisting first home buyers to build a deposit inside superannuation. Voluntary contributions of up to $15,000 per year and $30,000 in total will attract concessional tax treatment under the First Home Super Saver Scheme,

       <p class="italic">
        allowing older Australians to contribute proceeds from downsizing their home into superannuation. Individuals aged 65 and over will be able to make a non-concessional contribution of up to $300,000 in proceeds from the sale of a principal residence into their superannuation,

        Australian Government response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report:

        Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Requirements for Australian Citizenship and Other Measures) Bill 2017 [Provisions] March 2018

       <p class="italic">
        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 15 June 2017, the Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Requirements for Australian Citizenship and Other Measures) Bill 2017 (the Bill) was introduced into the Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 22 June 2017, the Senate referred the Bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 5 September 2017.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 14 August 2017 and introduced into the Senate on 15 August 2017. The Bill was discharged from the Senate notice paper on 18 October 2017. Prior to the Bill being discharged from the Senate notice paper, the Government circulated proposed amendments to the Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments provide that the measures announced on 20 April 2017 will commence on 1 July 2018, rather than applying to applications for citizenship made on and after 20 April 2017. The amendments also provide that the English language requirement be changed from 'competent' to 'modest' English (a change from the equivalent of an

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendations

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.122 That the Government clarify the standard for English-language competency required for citizenship, noting that the required standard should not be so high as to disqualify from citizenship many Australians who, in the past, and with a more basic competency in the English language, have proven to be valuable members of the Australian community.
       </p>

        Response — Noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amendments circulated by the Government on 18 October 2017 propose to set the English language requirement at a 'modest' level of English. This is equivalent to an International English Language Testing System (IELTS) score of 5 or equivalent test score.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.123 That the Government reconsider the imposition of a two-year ban on applications for citizenship following three failed attempts of the citizenship test, and consider other arrangements that allow additional tests on a cost-recovery basis that would deter less-genuine applicants.

       <p class="italic">
        Response — Noted

       <p class="italic">
        3.124 That the Government consider introducing some form of transitional provisions for those people who held permanent residency visas on or before 20 April 2017 so that the current residency requirements apply to this cohort of citizenship applicants.

       <p class="italic">
        Response — Noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amendments circulated by the Government on 18 October 2017 propose to commence the new residency requirement on 1 July 2018. A person who makes an application for citizenship before 1 July 2018 would be subject to the current residency requirement.

        Leveraging our advantages: The trade relationship between Australia and Indonesia March 2018
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government thanks the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth for its inquiry report into Australia's trade and investment relationship with Indonesia. The Committee's report contains valuable insights into how Australia can benefit from an enhanced trade relationship with Indonesia, particularly in the context of the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IA" rel="nofollow">
         IA
        </a>
        -
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEPA" rel="nofollow">
         CEPA
        </a>
        ) currently under negotiation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As the report notes, trade and investment is one element of the Australia-Indonesia bilateral relationship that has historically lagged behind the others. In 2016, Indonesia was only Australia's 13th largest trading partner - lower than
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        or Thailand, which have comparatively smaller economies. However, in line with Indonesia's rapidly developing economy, Australia is presented with an opportunity to strengthen the economic relationship to the significant benefit of both countries. The IA-CEPA is an important part of our efforts to make the most of this opportunity, including in areas such as healthcare, tourism, education and agricultural products.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The report's recommendations include that the Australian Government develop an information campaign to actively promote the business opportunities presented by the IA-CEPA. The Government supports this recommendation, and will engage with the private sector following finalisation of the agreement to ensure that Australian businesses are in a position to reap the benefits of its implementation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The report further recommends that the Government prioritises the development of infrastructure in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        to facilitate maritime, education and tourism services partnerships with Indonesia. The Government is fully cognisant of the need for greater investment in infrastructure in Northern Australia to benefit from its proximity to Asian markets. The potential benefits are outlined in the

        The Government takes a case-by-case approach to the inclusion of ISDS commitments in international trade agreements. Bilateral investment with Indonesia is already subject to ISDS under the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA) and the 1992 bilateral investment treaty.

        Negotiations on investment-related commitments in IA-CEPA are ongoing and, should ISDS provisions be included in IA-CEPA, they will reflect widely accepted modern rules on the treatment of investors, including robust safeguards to preserve the Government's right to regulate in the public interest.
