        (3) The committee shall scrutinise each instrument as to whether:

        (a) it is in accordance with its enabling Act and otherwise complies with all legislative requirements;
       </p>
       <p>
        (b) it appears to be supported by a constitutional head of legislative power and is otherwise constitutionally valid;

        (h) it trespasses unduly on personal rights and liberties;

        (j) it contains matters more appropriate for parliamentary enactment; and
       </p>
       <p>

       </p>
       <p>
        (4) The committee shall also scrutinise each instrument to determine whether the attention of the Senate should be drawn to the instrument on the ground that it raises significant issues, or otherwise gives rise to issues that are likely to be of interest to the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        (5) The committee may, for the purpose of reporting on its terms of reference, consider any proposed or draft legislative instrument, including an exposure draft of such an instrument.

            Standing Committee
           </a>
           on Regulations and Ordinances is one of the Senate's oldest and most respected committees. It has always operated as a technical, nonpartisan scrutiny committee, responsible for scrutinising delegated legislation made by the executive branch of the government. The committee ensures, on the Senate's behalf, that executive-made laws comply with the fundamental principles of parliamentary supremacy and the rule of law. This notice of motion proposes amendments to the standing orders in accordance with these principles and the unanimous recommendations of the committee's 2019 inquiry report.
