         and a member of the first House of Representatives. She was also the great-granddaughter of Sir John Bray, the first

His father was also the member for Sturt, from 1949 to 1966, serving for 16 years with a brief period out of office from 1954 to 1955. Following in his father's footsteps, Ian was elected to the seat of Sturt, taking over from his father in 1966. Like his father, Ian lost the seat from short period. Labor's

         held the seat for three years, from 1969 to 1972, before Ian's re-election in 1972. Ian became a member of the executive of the Fraser government when he was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, a position he held for four months before being appointed to the ministry. Ian had three ministerial appointments. He was Minister for

         By today's standards Ian Wilson was a liberal rather than a conservative. It is notable that some of the issues Ian Wilson was particularly interested in as a parliamentarian remain current for this parliament some 20 years on. The question on the constitutional recognition of local government was opposed by the coalition in the 1988 referendum, though Ian Wilson supported the question. At the next election, the issue of constitutional recognition of local government will again be the subject of a referendum question. Hopefully the question will be successful later this year, perhaps even with the support of conservative parties. Similarly, and like our current South Australian Senate colleagues, Ian Wilson was interested in addressing the issues of water quality and water flow in the Murray-Darling system. This is another issue that this Labor government has addressed in this parliament, with the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Ian's position on income splitting for families has in part been met through tax benefits for families with children. Even so, the issue of the appropriate level of income support for women in the workforce who have children remains current for the conservative members of this parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ian Wilson served as a notable member of the liberal tradition in the Australian parliament. On behalf of the government, I offer condolences as to his wife, Mary, and to his sons, Keith, Richard, James and Nigel, and their families.

          Today we mourn a man who was universally regarded as one of nature's gentlemen—softly spoken, somewhat diffident in manner and completely decent. I speak of the Hon. Ian Bonython Cameron Wilson AM. He was part of the unique group of Oxbridge educated small 'l'

          grew up in a family which believed in service to the community and the nation. Their service over several generations is such that their family history is interwoven with South Australia's history. Ian was born in Adelaide in 1932. He was the son of Sir Keith Wilson, a prominent

          , who actually proposed the toast for the then young Ian's 21st birthday and was part of the inspiration for Ian's career in politics. It is worth remembering that Ian's father, Keith, served for 20 years in the federal parliament—six of them in the Senate—during which time he also served in the

         </p>
         <p>
          In 1958, at the time of the split of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLP" rel="nofollow">
           DLP
          </a>
          from the Labor Party, Ian stood for the seat of Adelaide but lost as a result of the leakage of DLP preferences. On his father's retirement, in 1966, after winning a plebiscite—and here is a number—of the 10,000 party members in the Sturt electorate, Ian Wilson retained the then enormous seat for the Liberal Country League. Following a disadvantageous redistribution, he lost it by about 500 votes to Labor in 1969—to a colourful waterside worker, 'Stormy Normy' Foster. Not to be outdone, he ran for Sturt again in 1972 and beat
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Foster" rel="nofollow">
           Norm Foster

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
           Gough Whitlam
          </a>
          was winning everywhere else. He held the seat as a marginal seat thereafter.

         <p>
          As a backbencher at the old

           Parliament House

          , he shared offices with one
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Winston_Howard" rel="nofollow">
           John Winston Howard
          </a>
          for a period of 18 months. According to Ian, they got to know each other quite well and respected each other, as they both strongly supported the Liberal cause. Ian respected that Mr Howard was more on the conservative side, and Howard respected that Wilson was more on the small 'l' liberal side of the broad church known as the Liberal Party.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ian became a minister in the final years of the Fraser government. From March 1981 to May 1982, he was the minister for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
           Home Affairs
          </a>
          and the Environment. During his ministry he oversaw the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">
           World Heritage
          </a>
          listing of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
           Great Barrier Reef
          </a>
          over the initial opposition of the then
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Premier" rel="nofollow">
           Queensland Premier
          </a>
          , Joh Bjelke-Petersen. During this time, in his ministerial capacity, he also went to Cocos (Keeling) Islands to tell John Clunies-Ross that his rule of the islands was at an end. He protected the red crab on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
           Christmas Island
          </a>
          . One wonders how all these things occurred without the Greens, but a lot of things did occur, and Mr Wilson has a great record. He also oversaw the National Gallery's transition from collecting towards exhibiting. Given the intense effort he had put into the home affairs portfolio, Ian was disappointed to be so quickly elevated to Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
           Social Security
          </a>
          , which occurred as a result of a reshuffle. Like his father, Ian had an abiding interest in social security. In his maiden speech in 1967, Ian made the following remarks, which are relevant today:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          For the last eighteen years a Liberal-Country Party Government has implemented policies which have permitted the economic growth of the nation. The growth rate has outstripped the rate at which the population has increased, with the result that the standard of living has improved significantly. The real value—the purchasing power—of wages increased and there have been improvements in ancillary benefits such as long service leave and annual leave.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … The steady yet dramatic economic progress which has been made has enabled the Government to embark upon the development of a comprehensive social security programme.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ian then went on to detail that program before stating:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Members on this side of the House believe in adequate provision not only for the aged, the invalid, the widowed, the sick and the unemployed, but also for the children.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ian was particularly interested in the impact of taxation on families and throughout his career was an advocate of income splitting, which was eventually included in the coalition's 1984 tax policy. It would be good if that could be revisited, but I doubt it will be.
         </p>
         <p>
          During the Hawke-Keating years, Ian played an active role in the Martin banking inquiry. Ian Wilson was a classic 'small l' or moderate liberal, who played a prominent role in the formation of the South Australian
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Movement" rel="nofollow">
           Liberal Movement
          </a>
          . Indeed, for some years he used his influence to contain the Liberal Movement within the confines of the South Australian Liberal Party, before it eventually separated. He described his political philosophy as follows:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I was a Liberal rather than a Conservative. But I believed that the Liberal Party of that period, as of even earlier periods, had to be a broad based party in circumstances where its members had the opportunity within the party to express their views and they would win some arguments and they would lose some arguments. But the give and take then was a strength that the party had.
         </p>

          In 1993 Ian Wilson retired from parliament, having lost the preselection for the seat of Sturt to one

          . The circumstances by which Ian lost the preselection for Sturt have become the stuff of folklore, and I will leave that issue to others. The then South Australian state director of the Liberal Party,

          and has a great and distinguished record of service to the party and the country.

          After parliament, Ian returned to his career as solicitor. He was a highly respected solicitor and became involved in a number of charities. He also chaired the company managing the heritage listed Adelaide Arcade. Continuing his interest in the arts from when he was minister, Ian became national chairman of the May Gibbs Children's Literature Trust. The

          wanted to use May Gibbs's harbourside home, Nutcote, at

          , as a museum rather than as a facility that encouraged today's writers for children. Ian took over the corporate structure to help run the May Gibbs Children's Literature Trust, which has given children's writers the opportunity to have a quiet creative time in studio apartments around Australian capitals, despite funding being cut by the

          In 2002 Ian Wilson was made a

          . Significantly, the citation on his award read 'for service to the community through a range of literature, health, social welfare and cultural organisations.' In other words, his AM was not for his role as a parliamentarian but for his service to the community in the areas that were mentioned in the citation. Indeed, over his life Ian was involved in many charitable organisations, including as
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President" rel="nofollow">
           Vice President
          </a>
          of the South Australian Good Neighbour Council, Vice President of the British and Foreign Bible Society, Chairman of St Matthew's Home for the Aged and President of the Australian Birthright Movement, now the Lone Parent Family Support Service. In 2001 Ian was awarded a
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenary_Medal" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
          for his 'service to public life as a federal member of parliament and minister'. Ian was a committed Anglican.

          I am told that Ian Wilson deliberately elected not to have a state funeral, believing that those who wished to honour his life would attend regardless. And, at his funeral on 10 April in Adelaide,

          was packed. It was attended by many of his former colleagues from the Labor Party as well as the Liberal Party, including his contemporary

          I could not end this condolence speech without paying a special tribute to Ian's wife of 52 years, Mary. Mary helped Ian doorknock his electorate. She looked after the family while Ian was at parliament, taking the whole family to Canberra when parliament sat during school holidays. By all accounts, she is a truly exceptional woman. Our condolences extend to Ian's remarkable wife, Mary, to his four children, Keith, Richard, James and Nigel, and to their families. The coalition mourns a truly great Australian whom we are proud to call one of our own.
