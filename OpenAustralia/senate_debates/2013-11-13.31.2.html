         I thank Senator Bushby for his question. He is a man who has established himself in this place as having a true understanding of all matters economic. The coalition took a very strong policy platform to the Australian people, a platform that the Australian people endorsed on 7 September. We said to the Australian people that we would work methodically and purposefully to restore the Australian economy. I might say to my friend and colleague from Tasmania that, as was heard in this place just yesterday in Her Excellency's speech, that is especially so for our home state of Tasmania.
        </p>
        <p>
         But what we are seeking to do specifically in relation to our policy is to abolish the carbon tax. Abolition of the carbon tax will mean a cost-of-living benefit to Australian households of approximately $550 per annum—a real, genuine economic stimulus. Instead of having to pay tax, they will have more disposable income to stimulate the economy. In removing the carbon tax, we will remove the imposts on the manufacturing sector that those opposite allegedly support. We will be removing the mining tax so that the great wealth generator of this country can continue to provide the dividends that our nation and economy so desperately need. We will restore the Australian Building and Construction Commission which, whilst it was allowed to operate under us, provided an economic welfare gain of $6.2 billion per annum. We will put the budget back into the black. We will methodically and purposefully work to ensure that the economy is put back into shape to create and support jobs.

           Regrettably, I think I am looking at the main impediment, and that is the Labor opposition and the

            Australian Greens

           . What they have not learnt from the election result is that the Australian people have spoken. The economic management of the past six years was simply not deemed to be up to scratch by the Australian people and, therefore, they voted for a change of government.

             If it was the best in the world, Senator Carr, you might like to contemplate why Australians voted for a change of management. Just think about that. They might remember that this was the minister for industry and the auto sector who saw the demise of Mitsubishi and then the demise of Ford. Now all of a sudden he is claiming that he is somehow concerned.

             The cost of living for pensioners will be enhanced by the removal of the carbon tax by $550 per annum. That will be of real benefit. And who is in the way? The Australian Labor Party—

                Senator Bushby, as the father of three young children, is rightly concerned about the future of the young within our country. They are our hope, they are our future and they are entitled to have proper job prospects. Under the past Labor regime, youth unemployment went from a disgraceful 10 per cent to an even worse 13 per cent. It is vitally important that we restore the economy to ensure that it has the capacity to employ and, especially, to employ young people.
               </p>
               <p>
                The social data is there for all to see: employment enhances physical health; it enhances mental health. And young people especially, on their way through life, should be given the opportunity of a job. We as a government will purposefully and methodically seek to bring that about by creating an environment—
