        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Skills and Training, Senator Watt. Can the minister update the Senate on how the Albanese Labor government's AUKUS submarine program's skills and training academy will help to upskill and attract the workforce to support and build the capabilities of Australia's world-leading defence industry?

         Last week, the Prime Minister announced Australia's optimal pathway to acquire conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarines. In addition to strengthening Australia's national security, this announcement will build a future made in Australia, by Australians, with record investments in defence, skills, jobs and infrastructure. As Senator Gallagher has stated, the program will create around 20,000 direct jobs over the next 30 years across industry, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

          Australian Public Service
         </a>
         . This includes trade workers, operators, technicians, engineers, scientists, submariners and project managers. At its peak, building and sustaining nuclear powered submarines in Australia will create up to 8½ thousand direct jobs in the industrial workforce.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's a decision which means many, many jobs for workers right around the country and, in particular, in the states of

         governments signed a cooperation agreement outlining our respective governments' commitment to supporting the construction of Australia's next generation of conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide. As part of the agreement, the Albanese government and South Australia will work towards the construction, establishment and operation of a skills and training academy campus in South Australia. The academy will be a dedicated hub to attract, grow, develop and qualify the shipbuilding workforce to meet current and future demands, and to provide opportunities for continuous development of the existing workforce. The academy will support the entire shipbuilding workforce, providing hands-on trades training and classroom based professional development backed by cutting-edge technology and modern facilities. This will be a whole-of-nation initiative and will incorporate multiple locations to deliver training where it's needed, with the central campus being built in South Australia.

            . The new skills and training academy will be delivered by working in lockstep with state and territory governments; unions; universities; education and training providers; and the scientific and technical sectors. It will be vital to supporting the capabilities of Australia's world-leading defence industry. Importantly, the academy will be responsive to, connected to and informed by Australian industry. This will be an academy that strengthens Australia's sovereign capabilities by growing our industrial workforce, ensuring that industry has the people and skills it needs to realise emerging opportunities across the shipbuilding economy. The Albanese Labor government has a strong record of working hand in glove with state and territory governments when it comes to skills development. In addition to the announcement of the new academy, the Albanese Labor government has also signed landmark skills agreements with every state and territory government, and that of course includes the delivery of 180,000 fee-free

               (—) (): The Albanese Labor government understands the life-changing benefits of vocational education and training to create good, secure jobs and to address skills shortages. Unlike what we saw from the former government—cutting

                TAFE

               and cutting training opportunities, until it was all too late—the Albanese Labor government is serious about building the skills of our workforce so that people have the opportunity to take on the jobs of the future. Australia's vocational education and training sector already contributes significantly to our naval shipbuilding and sustainment sector, providing diverse skills requirements ranging from complex engineering and design roles, and project management and logistics roles, through to highly advanced technician and trade roles. Our delivery of 180,000 fee-free TAFE and

               places in 2023 is further supporting this. The Albanese Labor government is investing in our greatest resource—our people. Our fee-free TAFE places will provide training opportunities, particularly focusing on priority groups; they'll increase workforce participation and address skills gaps in the economy.
