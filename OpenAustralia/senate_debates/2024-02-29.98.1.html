        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Gallagher. A short while ago, the Australian Border Force confirmed that a convicted sex offender who was released following the NZYQ decision has been arrested and charged with further sex offences yesterday in Melbourne. Why did the government not apply for a community safety detention order to redetain this serial sex offender, a decision that could only be made by a minister, not law enforcement?

         In relation to the matter that Senator Paterson raised, we are not going to comment on individual cases, because we will not prejudice court proceedings that are underway. We will continue to do everything in our power to keep the community safe; to deport individuals who have no right to be in the country; and to ensure that Operation
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEGIS" rel="nofollow">
          AEGIS
         </a>
         , which was established immediately following the High Court decision, has all of the support that the government can bring to it to ensure that law enforcement and security agencies are working together to deal with the release of this cohort of immigration detainees who were released by a decision of the High Court.
        </p>
        <p>
         The minister is working every single day with those security agencies and with his state and territory colleagues to make sure that everything is done that can be done to keep the community safe. As you know, there is a range of work underway: the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Home Affairs
         </a>
         , working with the Australian Border Force, working with the Community Protection Board. I have seen the work they are doing. I know you want to come in here to stir up and politicise all of these matters. Your natural inclination is to go straight to it, when you know exactly how hard those agencies are working. You know the challenges they face. You are seeking to undermine it here today.

          The minister is working with state and territory colleagues. He's working with all of the relevant agencies to keep the community safe. When there is an offence committed the law enforcement agencies respond as they have, and that matter is currently before the courts.

I'm not sure if it was Senator Hughes who made the imputation, but there was an imputation made. The reason I didn't hear it was that this chamber is too noisy. Yelling out is inappropriate from either side. Minister Gallagher.

                   Thank you. It took the opposition three years after passing HRTO legislation to make the first application to the court. This is the system that you called for. It's the system that this parliament passed. And—if I can quote you—the shadow minister for home affairs said there is 'a very high legal threshold to be met' for a court to continue to agree to ongoing detention. 'We are all aware that there is a high threshold, and we knew that when we put the legislation through the parliament before Christmas.' So that's what you know. They're the facts. You come in here and conveniently run a different line to the one you know is true and the one I am quoting from. The government is doing everything it can to keep the community safe. We have preventative detention, community safety supervision orders, electronic monitoring devices, curfews—

                      Will the government now apologise to the alleged victims and the people of Melbourne that you have failed to protect through your own inaction by failing to make a single application for a preventative detention order despite the parliament rushing them through before Christmas?

                       On the first issue, I think this has been well ventilated, around the work that is being done on preventative detention, and Senator Paterson understands that. You understand it well and you choose to ignore it. By doing so, you are ignoring all of the work that is happening across government and you are undermining that work—you are undermining that work!

                      <p>
                       In relation to all of the victims that have been involved in the NZYQ cohort, of course the government is committed to ensuring that everything is done to support victims and their families, and an enormous amount of work has gone into that as well.

                           Thank you. I was responding to that despite those opposite shouting at me. I can understand why Senator Paterson couldn't hear. We are committed to doing everything that we can—and I know the minister personally is—to support victims and their families who have been involved with this cohort. Senator Paterson understands exactly how much work is going into preventative detention. You know it and you come in here and you choose to ignore it.
