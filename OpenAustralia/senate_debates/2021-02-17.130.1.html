           Homebuilder is delivering targeted and timely stimulus to help build confidence and momentum in the industry across the country, particularly in regional areas. HomeBuilder was strongly welcomed by the Australian Forest Products Association when it was announced in June 2020 and when the government extended the scheme at the end of 2020 to protect the one million Australians employed in the construction industry. HomeBuilder will keep this pipeline of work flowing into 2021. The government is committed to supporting the Australian forestry industry, through the National Forest Industries Plan announced in 2018, which is supporting the forest industry's aspirational goal of planting one billion trees over the period to 2030. There is no stronger supporter of Australia's forest industry than this government.

              I thought it was a general practice that, if you made a statement, it was an indication of your voting intention and that you weren't calling a division. I was just wondering whether Senator Rice's intention was to vote against the motion and that's why she was intending to put her position.

                will be supporting this motion because of its focus on the plantation timber sector. I'm on the record and the Greens are on the record as being strong supporters of the plantation timber sector. Indeed, we need a plan so that we can have adequate plantation timber in Australia to enable the timber industry to transition completely to 100 per cent plantation based timber. We have seen how native forest logging is not the way forward for the timber industry. The Samuel review said:
