        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong, and I preface my question by acknowledging that the National Disability Awards will be held in Canberra tonight and that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        of People with Disability will be observed on Monday. Minister, given the draft National Disability Insurance Scheme legislation was publicly released on Monday by the government with the intention of introduction to the House tomorrow, will the government also announce this week the funding required to deliver a full National Disability Insurance Scheme?

          I thank the senator for his question and his ongoing interest in the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and I wish him well in his work inside his party room to get the opposition to take a more mature and bipartisan approach to this issue rather than playing politics with it.

                 This is a Labor government that is getting on with the job of building a National Disability Insurance Scheme. We understand how long people with a disability in Australia have been waiting for change and we understand the importance of delivering this for them. That is why this government, in a budget where we saw more revenue downgrades and more savings, delivered $1 billion in new funding for the first stage of a disability scheme. This is why the government has established the transition agency and agreed launch sites in
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                  New South Wales

                  ACT
                 </a>
                 . That is also why this government is introducing the legislation to which the senator referred in the question.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We have made clear our commitment to this issue. I note that those opposite, despite the fact that they said it is not real unless we can show costings now, are nevertheless going out and campaigning on a National Disability Insurance Scheme, notwithstanding they have never shown how they can get anywhere near their $70 billion of savings or cuts that they need nor how they would fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We have said very clearly that we understand the importance of this policy. We understand the importance of ensuring that it is fiscally sustainable and we will have more to say about this before the next budget.

                   As I was saying, the government has already said that we will have more to say about the plans for a National Disability Insurance Scheme next year. I would anticipate, as we have also said, that you should have regard to the sorts of savings decisions we have already made to see the approach that we would take to funding a whole range of priorities. Let us recall that this government has: delivered: an increase in the age pension, delivered the first statutory Paid Parental Leave scheme, increased child care, doubled school funding and increased funding to universities and research and infrastructure. We have done so by ensuring that we made savings in the budget—many of which have been opposed by those opposite—and we will continue the same responsible approach to funding priorities that we have demonstrated to date.

We on this side—and I will give the senator the benefit of the doubt because I think he is one on that side—care deeply about this issue. We are the party that built Medicare twice because those opposite and their predecessors tore it down.

                      in the same week that the legislation is introduced into the parliament. It is a straightforward question. People with disability want to know whether in addition to the legislation they are going to get the money to back it up and deliver an NDIS.

                       , I rise on the point of order: with respect, Senator Fifield, that was not the question. The nature of the question was how we could be taken seriously if we did not do it in the same week. Of course, it is relevant for Senator Wong to highlight how inconsistent any such suggestion is. It is relevant for her to highlight the countless opposition policies—indeed, those being canvassed by Mr Abbott this week—for which there is no funding commitment.

                         I remind those opposite, if they want to talk about commitment to this issue, that whilst they were in government, funding for disabilities went backwards. In fact, it grew at less than inflation. So for the opposition to come in here and run the sort of partisan gamesmanship that we have seen on this issue really demonstrates their lack of commitment to this issue.
