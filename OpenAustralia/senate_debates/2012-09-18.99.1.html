        have four amendments which I propose to move through fairly expediently. However, I do have some general questions to begin with and I understand Senator Whish-Wilson has some as well. I want to ask some general questions around the advice that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFMA" rel="nofollow">
         AFMA
        </a>
        received over this particular quota, but because that has raised some other issues I would like to ask questions around those issues too. First off, I would like to ask about the advice that was received by the advisory committee that has been the subject of much discussion. Was that advice accepted holus-bolus by the commission? Was that advice the advice that the commission then made its decision on?

         is an independent regulatory authority, so is not with us today because we are dealing with an environment bill. I will take your question on notice, but effectively you are asking if the commission makes an independent decision. Depending on which issue you are talking about—if you are talking about a particular event, perhaps you could outline that event, so I can take it on notice and obtain an answer for you. Broadly, the way it works is those two committees provide advice to the commission and then the commission acts independently and makes the decision.

          Specifically referring to the South East Management Advisory Committee meeting which has been the subject of much discussion and comments by the ombudsman, was that advice followed by the commission? This leads to the open practices of the advisory committee and other advisory committees and about whether other people who have acknowledged a conflict of interest have remained in and participated in meetings. Is this the one and only occasion where this has happened?

           is an independent regulator, but it is not here as we are dealing with an environment bill. I can take your question on notice as I do not want to speculate on what is in the individual commissioner's mind when they make decisions about these things. I am not the commissioner, but I will seek to obtain an answer for you.

            I appreciate that and that you are not the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. We are amending a specific piece of environment legislation but, as is pointed out, in this legislation you and the environment minister make the decisions jointly. I also appreciate
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFMA" rel="nofollow">
             AFMA

            is an independent body. However, I would think that the government has been following this up. If not, why not? I appreciate you have indicated you will take these questions on notice.

             I think you raised two separate matters. One is about issues concerning the ombudsman. That is an ongoing matter and is between the independent regulatory authority and the ombudsman who is investigating that and, as I understand it, has provided an interim report but not a final report on this matter. As that matter is ongoing, I do not intend to canvass it. It is up to the independent regulator to respond to that matter, so I will ask if the regulator wants to provide any additional comment in respect of that issue.
            </p>
            <p>
             The second question was: what is the department doing? On Friday I requested that the department look at a range of issues that have occurred and commence an investigation under section 44 of the legislation to ensure that all of these matters are looked at. That is ongoing and I do not have a response from that. That is what I am doing to ensure that it is clear.

               A broader matter. Again there are two parts, but these are different to the earlier two parts. One is an investigation into the procedures and processes that have been followed, because serious questions have been raised and these questions require answers. I think we need to have confidence in that agency as it is an independent regulatory authority. That is why I implemented the investigation, to ensure that we have the answers to those serious questions that have been raised. If you look at the ombudsman's correspondence, it mentions in the last or the penultimate paragraph—I do not have it before me—others matters that were also being looked at. That supports the view that there appear to be, at least on the face of it, serious questions that have been raised and do need a response. That investigation, in cooperation with
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAFF" rel="nofollow">
                DAFF
               </a>
               , will provide some guidance.
              </p>
              <p>
               Secondly, the broader review that I announced will look at the regulatory framework. This review will be undertaken by Mr Borthwick over the next three months. That will also provide a broader view of how
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFMA" rel="nofollow">
                AFMA

                The time line for that review is three months. Will the review accept submissions? Will those submissions be public? Will there be consultation processes as part of that review? If so, is there an intention to have a wide range of stakeholders involved in those public consultations?

                 At the moment some of the finer detail is being worked through. I would envisage that it would include stakeholders and people would be able to make submissions. It would depend on the way Mr Borthwick wants to conduct the review. I have not yet had an opportunity to speak with him directly, but I will have that conversation with him. Those are the areas I expect to be covered, but he will independently conduct the review and will have a view on those issues as well.

                  Will that review subsequently be made public? I have been asking these questions long enough to know that you will want to consider it first if it is made public, but what is the time line for making it public if, in fact, you will be making it public?

                   I expect, if you look at the matters I have been involved in in the past, that it will be made public. That would certainly be my first position.

                        go to the processes of ecological sustainable assessments. This is an environment question: how will this process relate to the process that was gone through in the past in terms of ecological sustainability assessments? Have you considered whether this root-and-branch review will impact on any of those assessments that have been done in the past and any that may be carried out in the future? Are you looking at any of those assessments in terms of some of the failures in the process of the

                         To be fair, we get into a chicken-and-egg type of arrangement. It would be sensible to allow the review to come forward and report because the interaction between two pieces of legislation would be dependent upon the management plans that

                             I am advised that the proposed amendments do not describe the definition of 'expert panel', and provide the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities with the flexibility to establish a panel and appoint the panel members with regard to the expertise required for each particular assessment. The expertise required to conduct an assessment may vary depending on the nature of the particular fishing activity and its potential impacts. For example, there will likely be a combination of assessment methods to determine the nature and scale of potential impacts, and this may require different specialists such as those in fishery modelling or who have done relevant research.

                                      I need to jump back to the investigation we were talking about earlier; I apologise for jumping around a bit. We talked about the time line for the review of the fisheries legislation but I neglected to ask you about the time line for the review but not for the investigation. What is the time line for that?

                                       . I asked them to do the investigation. At this point, we are just scoping out the level of work that is required and I expect they will come back to me shortly with some projections around time lines. I do not expect it to be particularly lengthy, but do not hold me to that either.

                                        Not meaning to be pedantic, but are we talking about weeks or months? There is a three-month process for the review of the fisheries legislation.

                                         I would envisage a much shorter period. This is an investigation by the department in relation to some procedures and processes that have been undertaken. It may be completed very quickly, on the basis that they can undertake the scoping work, do the work, come back and report in a relatively short period of time. I would envisage it being finished well inside three months. But if that were to change, I would be happy to write to you and explain why.

                                          Just so I can be clear, will this also look at issues about how many times people have declared conflicts of interest and the sorts of processes that have occurred around whether or not people have been asked to participate in decision making? Will those things also be covered?

                                             If you go back to the earlier comment, I have asked the department to investigate. I am not going to fetter them in their investigation nor am I going to direct them as to what they should or should not look at more broadly. I expect them to do a competent job, to look at the procedures and processes, particularly around the issues the Ombudsman has raised. I have confidence in the department that they will undertake the work that you have described as part of the assessment of that work—and you would expect them to do that.

                                               I asked on Friday, before the letter from the Ombudsman, for an investigation to be commenced because questions had been raised that I considered were serious questions that required answers. I note that the Ombudsman also raised compliance with section 64C, which goes to the declaration of conflicts of interest and, as I understand it,
                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFMA" rel="nofollow">

                                               have admitted to that. I note at the end of that letter they went to other matters. In asking the department to scope out some of the work, they have also noted that and I am confident that they will include that in the work that they will undertake with AFMA. It is about making sure that the procedures and processes that AFMA adopt are what you would expect.

With all of these things, it is usually my predisposition to make them publicly available, provided there are no commercial-in-confidence matters or other matters that might require follow-up. But, by and large, that would be my predisposition.

Will this review provide the information around the planning for the supertrawler, particularly the participants and the funding? An example might be the Francisco J Neira report in 2011. For example, who instigated that report and who funded that report?

On the review, I do not envisage it as an opportunity to ask questions. I think the review is going to undertake a legislative review of the two acts. I am not going to fetter Mr Borthwick. He will work through the terms of reference that have been provided to him and do a competent job.

Was he provided with a brief when he tabled the strategy? Did that strategy that he had tabled refer to the fact that, in relation to this particular fishery:

In relation to that, can we at least have an assurance that the minister knew what he was doing when he tabled the first draft of the legislation and his second reading speech? Then can you tell us: if he did know what he was doing in tabling the first draft of the bill and his second reading speech, why, 24 hours later, did he have to make so many amendments and so many changes?

                                                              Surely there must be departmental officials available who can advise the minister as to what input the department had in relation to the first bill, if I can describe it as such—and, in fact, I can; I understand it was the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill. Who drafted it, on whose instructions and who had input into it? Then, the follow-up question would be, in relation to the second bill, which then changed its name to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Commercial Fishing Activities) Bill, who had input into that?

Are you really telling us that we had people administering this legislation that did not understand the differences between those three fishing activities?

The interim declaration process facilitates the prohibition of a declared commercial fishing activity while consultation with affected operators occurs over a period of up to two months. The final declaration process imposes a longer term ban for a maximum of two years while an expert assessment can be undertaken of the potential impacts of the fishing activity.
                                                                        </p>

The environment minister must, in making a final declaration, take into account the comments provided by affected fishing concession holders and can only make a final declaration in relation to the same activity that was the subject of an interim declaration.

I am certainly not going to argue either case here. All I can say—and I think it is reasonable to say it—is that both declarations require the environment minister and the fisheries minister to agree that there is uncertainty about the environmental impacts of the fishing activity. How that would be viewed would depend on the decision, how it was implemented, the procedural fairness that was provided and of course the circumstances which a tribunal may take into account in deciding to review it in any way.

Therefore, all the ministers have to say is, 'We believe there is uncertainty; you prove otherwise,' and they can stop a commercial fishing activity for up to a period of two years. Is that what this legislation will allow for?

I would have thought, irrespective of what side of the chamber you sit on, Minister, you would accept that that is the role of the committee stage in a bill so that senators can actually get an understanding of how it will be implemented and any misunderstandings—as senators can be disabused of them so that a full understanding can be achieved. If all we are going to get is, 'Well, read the bill for yourself; that is going to be its interpretation,' I fear that that is not exactly what the committee process was designed for. It was in fact designed to deal with these issues so that there can be clarity as to what is meant by the legislation. But when a minister cannot even explain it, it once again highlights how this legislation has been rushed through. Minister, is there any objective process that the ministers need to go through prior to making the interim declaration?

And, if that is the case, why is it that Labor senators have been out in Tasmania, along with a Greens senator, celebrating the fact that this trawler has now been stopped? I think we have an issue there of integrity and process, but of course with this government that should not surprise. I have one final question before I hand over to Senator Colbeck. Have you received any advice whatsoever in relation to the possibility of compensation in relation to Seafish Tasmania? In answering that, have you actually sought advice?

Senator Abetz has asked you some questions about what might trigger an intervention. There are some questions about what action Minister Burke took to, as you say, deal with the uncertainty that he had about interactions—and I think we are talking about marine mammals—in relation to this fishery. That is the rationale that I have heard him give publicly as to why we are passing this legislation. What I want to know is who Minister Burke consulted with to actually inform himself in relation to his uncertainties about those marine mammal interactions—something that I think he calls bycatch.

Minister Ludwig has told us that there can be an interim declaration of up to two months, which he says deals with due process and fairness. And then there is the second-stage process to deal with the suspension of up to two years. But if we cannot be confident in this process of the work that Minister Burke has done to deal with his 'uncertainties' through this process, how can we have some confidence as to what he might be required to do as part of a declaration process? In this circumstance he is bringing in legislation. In the next process, if he does not do anything to deal with these uncertainties, he could be making decisions without any core information, and then how is due process, or fair process, dealt with as part of making a declaration?
