         I thank Senator Paterson for the question. I have to say that it's disappointing to hear Senator Cameron laugh. Senator Cameron, your former government presided over one of the worst rorts in the

         . They allowed shonky and dodgy providers to sign up vulnerable students to courses. The students had no capacity to complete the courses. They were offered inducements to complete the courses. They had no capacity at all or they didn't even know that they were signing up for a loan. We continue to clean up Labor's mess. What we have now done is introduce further legislation to ensure that we support the VET sector in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will give a real-life example of someone who suffered as a result of Labor's failed VET FEE-HELP. A lady by the name of Anita enrolled in good faith in a diploma of business over the phone in 2012, never having been told that she would be liable for the course fees. She made a decision to withdraw from the course shortly after commencement and contacted her provider.

         , do you know what happened to Anita as a result of Labor's failed VET FEE-HELP system? She was saddled with a debt of $18,000 because of the conduct of a dodgy provider allowed by those on the other side. Well, on this side of the chamber, we're going to go into bat for people like Anita, and we are going to ensure that we do the right thing by her and bring the VET system's reputation back—

            program is that the majority of providers are actually good providers and they actually do the right thing. They are legitimate registered training organisations. But what happens when you open up a system, like Labor did, to rorts and to dodgy providers? You sully the names of even those who are out there doing the right thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            So when we came into government we got rid of their scheme because it was a failed scheme. We introduced a new scheme. We weeded out the shonky providers, and we are now ensuring that those who were ripped off because of Labor's failed scheme can have their debts cancelled, because, on this side of the chamber, what do we want to see? We want to see all Australians, mums and dads in particular, looking at our vocational education and training system and saying, 'That is a system that we want our kids to choose so that they are job ready and they can go off into the workforce with the skills that employers need.'
