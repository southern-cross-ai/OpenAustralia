         As I was saying earlier, a range of information has been provided. The government has been committed and remains committed to passing the legislation around these issues. Following a series of detailed discussions with the Independent senators, we decided that to facilitate the passage of this bill we would compromise and provide some of the information that is available and that can sensibly be made available at this time. I am defining that it would be irresponsible, not sensible, to release information that would jeopardise ongoing commercial negotiations with Telstra, ongoing commercial negotiations with other carriers or ongoing commercial negotiations with construction companies on construction costs.

I am prepared to back the information in the business plan against Senator Ronaldson’s posturing, because at the end of the day what those opposite are about is opposing and wrecking the

                 . They had 11½ years to try to do something about broadband and the declining fortunes of this country when they were in government, and they failed miserably. They are up to their 20th broadband plan, and the good news is that it is three dot points—after nearly 15 years on broadband, they have a policy of three dot points.
