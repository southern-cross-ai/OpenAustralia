         I thank Senator Griff for the question. I do note, however, that Senator Griff is asking me to reflect upon a position taken by the opposition. It's for the opposition to speak of their position. However, I do note certain statements made by the opposition today that I welcome as constructive statements, in terms of what would be a continuance of long-held practice across matters of foreign policy and trade policy, where the parties of government seek to work in a constructive manner together. That does stand in some stark contrast to those on the crossbenches, at times, who seek to play politics with matters of national interest.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Griff's question was in relation to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
          TPP
         </a>
         -11. This is a trade agreement that is going to substantially expand access for Australian goods suppliers, Australian services suppliers and Australian investors to a wideranging marketplace. There are some 11 countries with a combined
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         of more than $13.8 trillion and close to 500 million consumers across the TPP countries. What we're going to see is enhanced market access for Australian exporters. I heard Senator Macdonald reference sugar producers, beef producers, grains producers, wine producers and a range of goods industries, as well as those in the services sector that have broadly welcomed the TPP. They have welcomed the opportunities it will provide for increased generation of income for Australians, and, as a result of that increased generation of income, increased job opportunities for Australians in the future too.

           As noted in Labor's additional comments, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
            TPP
           </a>
           waives labour market testing for contractual service suppliers for six signatory countries. This will mean jobs in Australia will be able to be filled by workers from Canada, Peru, Brunei, Mexico, Malaysia and Vietnam without being first offered to Australians. Has the Labor Party explained to you, minister, why they now think this is a good thing?

            There is commentary around the table. The last part of that question I do consider to be in order because it was asking the minister about something that had been said to him. I remind senators of the standing orders around what question time is for.

             For the opposition to speak for the opposition, I note that there is a statement by Mr Clare, the shadow trade minister, and I'm sure that Senator Griff could avail himself of that statement made by Mr Clare. Senator Griff asks about labour market testing provisions. I would simply note, for the benefit of the Senate and for Senator Griff, that the types of provisions contained in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
              TPP
             </a>
             -11 are not dissimilar to the types of provisions contained in a number of other agreements that Australia has negotiated. It's important to remember those provisions are part of an integrated package of ensuring that Australian producers—our farmers and our businesses—receive improved access to export markets. In doing so, billions of dollars of benefits are expected to accrue to Australia, and from those billions of dollars of benefits we can expect and should expect to see job benefits for hard working Australians too.
