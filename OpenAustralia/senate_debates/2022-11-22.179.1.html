        <p>
         The government does not support the amendments proposed by the Greens, and I will quickly run through why. One of the amendments seeks to increase the annual disbursement amount from what will be the Disaster Ready Fund from $200 million per year to $300 million per year. I inform Senator Pocock that, fundamentally, the reason for us opposing this amendment is to preserve, if you like, the principal of the fund so that it has enough money in it to be invested and to keep generating the return that we would then be spending on disaster mitigation going forward.
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
          Future Fund
         </a>
         Management Agency has considered the proposal in your amendment and advised that it would likely deplete the fund. It would essentially be taking out too much every year from that principal, rather than making sure that there were funds left to be invested. The bill's $200 million per year limit for resilience mitigation has been set for long-term sustainability of the fund, making sure that we can deliver sufficient funding for disaster resilience, while not overdrawing the fund. None of us, I think, would want to get to a point where this fund is fully depleted and unable to invest in that disaster mitigation going forward, and $200 million a year is the amount that we're advised can be spent from the fund every year without depleting it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Aside from that, that figure lines up with what has been recommended for investment in disaster mitigation at the federal level by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Productivity Commission
         </a>
         . They delivered a report in 2015 which recommended that the Commonwealth invest up to $200 million per year on resilience projects and for that to be matched by the states and territories. That's what we're proposing to do here. The amount also lines up with figures that the Insurance Council of Australia has called for to be invested in mitigation, which hopefully will provide some level of insurance relief to Australians as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is far from the only investment that our government is making in disaster resilience. While I appreciate Senator Pocock's desire to see even greater investment in disaster mitigation, our position is that we're keen to do that but not necessarily only through this fund. In addition to the funds that this bill will provide for, we've recently committed $800 million with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government to the New South Wales Resilient Homes Program for home buybacks and house raising and mitigation. We've also committed $750 million with the Queensland government for a similar program in Queensland. So there is significant money for betterment funding of infrastructure to bring it to a higher standard in both Queensland and New South Wales.
        </p>
        <p>
         The second proposal put forward by Senator Pocock in her amendments is essentially around the investment strategy to be used by the Future Fund. The government is not able to support this proposed amendment to introduce what would be a prohibition on certain types of investments from the Future Fund. However, the finance minister will work with the Future Fund and the Department of Finance to explore options for investments within the Future Fund that better align with the government's commitment to net zero by 2050.
        </p>
        <p>
         The legislation governing the Commonwealth's investment funds requires the board to maximise returns over the long term, consistent with best practice for institutional investment. The board integrates environmental, social and governance considerations into its decision-making process by assessing the potential impacts of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESG" rel="nofollow">
          ESG
         </a>
         matters on the risk and return of the portfolio. The board also exercises its ownership rights associated with investments according to the board's ESG policy, which considers a range of issues, including climate change, human and labour rights, sustainable supply chains, corruption and bribery. For those reasons, we'll be opposing the amendments.

          The opposition will also be opposing these amendments. As pointed out by the minister, one of the core things that would make for the success of this bill is the ability for the fund to generate returns. I note the government have made quite the story about the fact that, since its inception, the Emergency Response Fund has generated $800-odd million of returns on the initial investment. They are returns that are now in the fund. They are not returns that have been squandered or used by the former government in any way, shape or form, and they now underpin the ability for this fund to generate further returns. I really do want that noted.
         </p>
         <p>
          We also would not support anything that ties the hands of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
           Future Fund
          </a>
          and its ability to invest following best practice and due diligence. On that basis, we will not be supporting these amendments.

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
            Future Fund
           </a>
           in maximising returns versus investing in industries that are adding to climate change—which we are seeking, in this piece of legislation, to mitigate and adapt to. How are you weighing that up? Do you not see something like the Future Fund as having a requirement to invest in companies and industries that are congruent, that align with a future that Australians can be excited about and where young people can look us in the eye and know that we're doing what's required?

            Thanks, Senator Pocock, and thank you for your constructive engagement on this bill more generally. As I was saying in my speech—I'm not sure if you were here for that part of it—of course our government is taking serious action on climate change and the root causes of it, being carbon emissions. I think you supported the legislation that we put through the parliament around increasing Australia's emission reduction targets. That's what we really need to do, to bring down those emissions, and we're taking action on a global stage by being an active participant in negotiations around these issues internationally.
           </p>
           <p>
            When it comes to these investments, the finance minister is intending to work with the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
             Future Fund
            </a>
            and the Department of Finance to explore what options there are for investments, with the Future Fund, that better align with the government's commitment to net zero by 2050. I'm not in a position—that's not my role, finance minister—to give you a lot more detail at this point about exactly where that's heading, but that certainly signals to me an intention from the government to consider these issues.

             I have two questions for the minister, and thank you for that clarification. You've used the language of 'alignment with the government's values' in the direction that you will now give to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
              Future Fund
             </a>
             . Can you explore, a little further, what lies underneath that alignment? Is that an instruction to not invest in climate-destroying fossil fuels? What will that instruction say about fossil fuels? That's my first question.
            </p>
            <p>
             My second question is this. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBO" rel="nofollow">
              PBO
             </a>
             says that, at $3 billion in the fund, a drawdown of $300 million a year will permit the fund to last until 2047. When do you want to exhaust the fund? On your projections, keeping at $200 million a year drawdown, what year would you be exhausting the fund as currently proposed in the bill?

              (—) (): Thanks, Senator Pocock. In relation to your first question, I probably can't give too much more detail than what I've already said today, which is that this is something that is being explored by the finance minister in discussions with the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
               Future Fund
              </a>
              , as to what the investment strategy of the Future Fund is. I'm sure that Senator Gallagher would be happy to talk with you a bit further if you'd like to have some more detail about that. But, clearly, by me saying that we intend to better align the investment options with the government's commitment to net zero by 2050, this is clearly something that the finance minister is giving some thought to.
             </p>
             <p>
              For your second question, I must admit I haven't seen that

               PBO
              </a>
              research that you're citing. What we're relying on, as I said earlier, is the advice from the Future Fund. That advice is that, really, we can only have a maximum of $200 million per year to ensure that we don't run down the principle of this fund at any point. I stand to be corrected by the advisers who are here, but my understanding is that we don't see the fund being fully depleted by setting a $200 million mark. Obviously, the amount that the fund earns every year will differ depending on investment returns in the market. Even in the time I was the shadow minister, I remember there were some years that generated a very big return, and some years generated a lower return. But, if you like, the $200 million figure is essentially an averaging out—and I don't mean that precisely; I'm just talking generally. But that is an average amount that we could spend from this fund while maintaining that principle at around the $4 billion mark so that we can keep investing it and generate the kinds of returns that we can then spend every single year.

                 had with the exceptional circumstances legislation in agricultural support is that the particular circumstances of Western Australia, in terms of its geographical spread of population, was quite different to the eastern states. Have you considered how disbursements from this fund will cater for the particular requirements of the jurisdiction of Western Australia, given that, whilst we are relatively small in terms of population, we are a significant contributor to both the economic output of Australia and the economic exports from Australia?

                  I'm not sure if you heard the part of the debate where I was mentioning that we're currently in the process of developing the guidelines for how this fund will be used, the types of things it will be able to be used for and where it would be spent.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I would not envisage that we would go forward with a specific allocation by state or territory, and I don't think that was done under the former scheme by the former government. But I would certainly expect that all states and territories would share in the benefit of these funds. I think it's pretty commonly known that there are some parts of the country that are more disaster prone than others, so it may well end up being that there is a bit of weighting towards those. But none of those decisions have been made at this point in time. I'd be more than happy, if you'd like to participate in the consultation about those guidelines, to include you in that.

                   I certainly accept that some parts of Australia are more population heavy and differ, perhaps, in terms of the particular needs of individuals and communities within the Australian society. However, I'm wondering if, for those guidelines, you would envisage taking in economic impacts as well as purely human impacts?

                    respects your upholding of the standing orders and processes here! As I say, Senator Brockman, we're still working through what the guidelines would involve. But I think it's a fair point that you make—that we need to be thinking not just about human impact but about economic impact. I had some meetings today with some groups about the economic impacts on supply chains that we see from natural disasters, so I think it would be reasonable to expect that there would be a broad range of factors that would be taken into account in determining what gets funded and what doesn't. But again I'd be happy to take any thoughts that you've got as we're preparing these guidelines.

Again, I'm more than happy to have our agency brief you on where they're up to it and to take your thoughts on that. I would hazard a guess that we'd be looking at early 2023 by the time the guidelines are finalised. Given that money is available under this fund from 1 July next year, I'd be quite keen to start an application process in the first half of next year so that we can then start funding projects as early as possible once that financial year starts. I'd be looking at early 2023 finalising the guidelines.

                           Minister, firstly, as a former emergency management minister, I want to congratulate the Labor government on continuing an investment fund that will ensure that our nation can invest in mitigation projects on the ground in local communities to really flip the traditional model in this country of droughts and flooding rains, where we spend 97 per cent of money on fixing up floods and bushfires and cyclonic activity and only three per cent in actually preparing for the future. It's one of the great legacies of the coalition government that we took the brave step of setting up this fund and setting aside portions annually to be supporting state and local governments to mitigate against future disasters.

                           I do have a couple of questions. My first is: how has this money has been raised? I had the opportunity to speak at the Australian local government roads seminar down in Hobart a couple of weeks ago. I'm sure a lot of local mayors have all contacted you and your office about the torrential rains and flooding that we're going through at the moment, but the ongoing

                           situation has also wrought havoc on rural and regional roads. The New South Wales regional councils have come out saying it's a crisis. The Victorian regional councils have all similarly come out saying it is a crisis. Some are looking to the

                           A arrangements to really fund that recovery process; others are looking at similar times in our history when we've had to go to the infrastructure portfolio to fund the particular and specific needs of such unique situations that we're finding ourselves in at the moment with the flooding impact on regional roads in particular. Would you be able to give us an understanding of whether it's going to be DRFA? Is it this particular funding pool that will be able to be accessed or is it a matter for infrastructure ministers—state and federal—to come to an agreement on?

                            . I well remember our many discussions about these funds in past estimates hearings and on other occasions. You're right—and I've made this point in the Senate just this week—that one of the major consequences of the flooding that we're seeing at the moment is the massive damage to roads and infrastructure around a lot of rural and regional Australia. I've seen those roads, I've driven on those roads, and you probably have as well. Whether we're talking about roads that are cut off or bridges that are suffering from erosion or potholes, or rail impacts, there are massive impacts out there and it's going to be a very costly bill. I've had a number of discussions with mayors already as I've travelled around the country into these flood areas, and it's pretty much the No. 1 issue they are raising with me.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            At this point in time, our intention is to fund those sorts of repairs through the
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRF" rel="nofollow">
                             DRF
                            </a>
                            A arrangements, as your government often did in these situations. In some parts of the country we're still at a relatively early stage of assessing the exact impacts of these floods. There are some parts of the country where we still have flood waters in place at the moment and we may well be seeing more. I know for a fact that there are state governments and local governments who have already begun the work of repairs to infrastructure in some parts of the country. In other parts of the country, that hasn't been possible yet because of the conditions. I have personally told a number of mayors that they can absolutely rely on the federal government to deliver funding for those repairs and infrastructure in the way your government did, through those DRFA arrangements. If something additional to that is necessary through the general infrastructure program, then of course we would consider that, but at this point in time what we're trying to do is make those DRFA arrangements work.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I should also say that, even in the short time we have been in office, we have announced substantial amounts of funding for betterment of roads and infrastructure. That's something that mayors have been speaking to me about for many years—back to my days in the Queensland government. We need to be building back better, not just repairing things to the standard they were, so we've done a lot of that already in
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

                            . I feel like we may have committed to a similar program in Queensland as well, and where there's an opportunity to do that around the current floods, we'd look at doing that as well.

There was a real concern that the money that the state government had put on the table, when you shared it around, wasn't actually going to cut the mustard, so that will be of great relief.

Have the regulatory guidelines and frameworks within the DRFA itself been changed so that state governments will be applying to build back better on assessments, or is that still work that is under discussion with states?

                              The short answer is that the work is still under discussion with state and local governments. I am aware that your government commenced two reviews of the

                              A, neither of which were completed by the time of the election, so that is work that we've picked up. To be honest we have decided to broaden that further, and we're in discussions with the states and territories about that at the moment. Having said that, where there are opportunities to streamline payments while we're doing that broader review, we're taking those opportunities, and we've made some changes to that effect already, not so much in the infrastructure space but in payments to individuals, small businesses and other groups—I think primary producers as well. That review I expect to be kicking off before too long. Certainly, as I say, we would like to think that building resilience into the system would be an outcome of that review, and it sounds like it's something that you've been a fan of as well.

                                A works is to repair infrastructure back to its pre-disaster standard, but as I'm sure you would recall, the DRFA also does allow for betterment funding, if you like, as a separate stream of funding. My recollection is that it's categories B and D of the DRFA that allow for betterment funding to be provided. That's the way that we have provided that betterment funding to

So there is still the ability to do betterment programs, but they have to be, if you like, separate to the usual repair programs. We may well end up doing similar things for these floods, but as I say, it's still fairly early days in actually assessing the scale of the damage across the number of different states that it's impacting on.

                                  , the new agency, have been in regular discussion with the Victorian government about repairs to infrastructure. I myself have had conversations with the Victorian emergency management minister about this issue and that there is going to be a need for significant funding. We've talked about the potential for betterment as well.

                                  One of the issues is that Victoria is in caretaker mode at the moment, which you would recall makes these discussions a little more difficult than usual. Also, as I said, I know that some road infrastructure repairs have already started in Victoria, but there are still a huge number of assessments going on because of the scale of the damage.

                                   I absolutely agree, Minister. It's my understanding from communities in Victoria that your forward-leaning posturing as a federal government with that jurisdiction would be much appreciated, as there has been with other jurisdictions. As the DFRA arrangements have become more sophisticated over time and the emergencies these communities have faced over time have become more complex and more critical some state governments have been better than others at actually understanding their responsibilities under the DFRA arrangements to access the critical funds that we have available at a federal level. We saw that obviously with

                                   I would appreciate you leaning very forwardly into the Victorian jurisdiction to assist them. Queensland is very highly developed. Unfortunately, Queensland is a jurisdiction that experiences more than its fair share of natural disasters, but as a result it has a very highly developed and professional response to those disasters and a very nuanced understanding of the opportunities available between state and federal governments.

                                     There we go. For my sake let's call it the Emergency Response Fund. Local governments already have long pipelines of local projects that they know they need to deliver to mitigate future disasters, whether they be flood levees, seawalls or other hard infrastructure to protect their communities from a future disaster. There is a concern that this money will be set aside for mitigation projects. It is often hard for local governments to actually source that funding from state governments. There is a concern that this will be going towards those pipelines of infrastructure projects that already exist across the country with local governments in conjunction with state governments and won't be going to social services, charities et cetera. It will be for those hard, often unsexy, infrastructure projects that actually do the heavy lifting during natural disasters.

                                      Just before I respond to your questions, Senator

                                      , I want to say that your questions have obviously been about Victoria, but I have now had similar discussions with emergency management ministers in a number of states—not just in Victoria—about repairs to infrastructure and betterment opportunities. As I said, we have approved funding for betterment definitely in

                                      and I'm pretty sure in Queensland as well, but that's in relation to events that took place several months ago, so no criticism should be levelled at the Victorian or any state government about what's happening right now. As you would know, sometimes those betterment discussions happen a little bit further along after the event.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      I think I understand your question to mean, 'Will we use what will be the Disaster Ready Fund to invest in physical infrastructure?' I would certainly expect that a sizeable portion would be used for that purpose. You may not have heard me say we're in the process of consulting on guidelines for the fund now. I've invited the shadow minister and Senator Brockman and I'd be happy to invite you to be part of those discussions about what we should use these funds for.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      The examples I've always given in the public about how this fund would be used have tended to be physical infrastructure like flood levees, drainage improvements and cyclone shelters—things like that. But that doesn't rule out potentially using them for social services, community resilience and those kinds of things as well. You would know, I'm sure, that there are many communities out there, including local governments, that want to prepare community resilience plans. That's a really worthwhile thing to do. We're waiting until we have that consultation occur to finalise exactly how it could be spent, but I would certainly expect to see a substantial portion of this used to clear the long backlog of local government mitigation projects that exists.

                                       I have a final question on the back of that. There is grave concern in the local government community.

                                       on where they see the best spend for this money? It is incredibly difficult for local councils to get the type of money they need to build these sorts of projects. It's been expressed to me that it is a great concern for them that this bill will change how that money is spent—on that community resilience piece instead of the types of infrastructure projects we need to stop the need for, potentially, those future resilience projects in communities. I understand it is not the government's intention for 100 per cent of the funds to be used to address the local government infrastructure pipeline that already exists in this country against natural disasters.

                                        I think it is worth pointing out that, had the Emergency Response Fund been used more by the former government, we may not have had quite as long a backlog of local government and mitigation projects. But we are where we are, and we do have that backlog. For starters, local governments are being consulted, and heavily consulted, about how these funds should be used. If A

                                        haven't been consulted so far, then they are absolutely on the list and will be consulted.

                                        I should say that the discussions and consultation we undertook with ALGA, with state based local government associations and with individual state governments were one of the reasons we committed to creating this fund. The feedback we were getting was that we weren't seeing the level of federal investment in disaster mitigation at a local level that we needed to see. That's one of the reasons that we've decided to go down this path and set up the fund this way. They will certainly be consulted if they haven't been already.

                                       <p>
                                        I would expect that we would see a substantial amount of this funding used to assist local governments to build those projects that are needed; I would certainly expect to see that. I've said already that, where possible, we want to see our funds matched by state, territory and local governments. I always say 'where possible' because we recognise there are some extremely remote local governments, for example, that might have only a couple of hundred ratepayers but have a lot of disaster resilience needs. There might be exceptions in certain cases. But we want to work with local governments and we recognise they play an important role here.

                                         Thank you, Minister, for your earlier offer of a briefing and discussion with the Minister for Finance. I'd be delighted to take that up. I have just one question. You indicated that you don't support the amendment we've proposed for a larger drawdown annually. We're suggesting $300 million. My question is: what's the purpose of having a fund last beyond a period in which we are theoretically at net zero, when temperatures are rising right now and natural disasters are getting worse right now? Isn't it sensible to be spending now for preparation, rather than holding on to the funds for later?

                                          Thanks, Senator Pocock. I've been reminded that the legislation provides for a review of the annual disbursement level in five years time, so there would be an opportunity to have a look at it at that point in time. I would like to see this fund last in perpetuity, beyond 2047, beyond 2050. I think that as a country we always need to be investing more in disaster resilience, and should the fund end up, due to very high investment returns, earning a much higher principal, it may be possible to increase the annual disbursement amount down the track. But the advice that we've received so far is that, if we want to be able to continue generating roughly $200 million a year in investment returns that can be used for this purpose, that is the limit of what we can be spending from the fund every year. If we were to go to $300 million in the way that you've proposed, that would gradually erode the principal of the fund, which would mean that we would not be generating the kinds of investment returns we need every year to be able to keep going at the $200 million level, let alone $300 million.

                                           With your indulgence, Minister, I want to bring you back to a couple of issues that you raised when you were responding to Senator

                                           . The first was about the existing disaster recovery funding arrangements and the investment in the response of the government. As I said before, I credit your government with taking the off-the-shelf arrangements that you inherited and utilising them. Having learned from past experiences, you are rolling it out. I have a question that was put to me today. There was an announcement put out by you and the

                                           are still waiting to find out whether they are eligible for disaster recovery payments, for example. I'm interested to understand from you how we can pre-emptively declare disaster recovery payments for South Australia while local government areas in New South Wales and, indeed, in Victoria—although a lot of them have been brought on board now—have had to wait for the flood peaks to pass for assessments to be made. That's my first question.

                                            . The announcement we made today for disaster assistance for South Australia is actually for nine local government areas that are already experiencing some level of flooding along the river, so they're not pre-emptive. I know the state opposition in South Australia have called for pre-emptive action here, and you might want to chat with them about why they think that should happen. But, in fact, the

                                            s in South Australia that are eligible for funding are already experiencing a level of flooding. Of course, every indication is that that flooding is going to get worse, whether it be in those LGAs or in others. As that flooding occurs, we will inevitably end up extending the LGAs that receive that assistance. If you have examples of LGAs in

Have you got an intergovernmental agreement with the states already about them matching the funding for mitigation processes, or is that a work in progress?

                                              That is a work in progress. What I have said is that, where possible, we want to see that funding matched by state, territory and local governments. As I said, we're working through the guidelines at the moment about how that will work, so it's a work in progress. Thank you for prompting me, Senator

I think you have some appreciation of the amount of work that is involved in dealing with disasters on such a wide scale. My office and my agency have been working incredibly long hours on this, not just in relation to the current floods but really since we took office—so through July as well. I want to put on record my gratitude to them; they're a great team.
