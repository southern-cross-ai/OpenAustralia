          These are important matters that go to parliamentary privilege, which is absolute. I want to place on record my thanks for the President's engagement on this and his commitment to ensuring that the parliamentary privilege protections that are afforded to members of this place are retained in a very different environment in which there is substantially more information obtained and held by other parties. So I do want to say to you,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
           Mr President
          </a>
          , that the opposition has appreciated your engagement on this and we look forward to the revision of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOU" rel="nofollow">
           MOU
          </a>
          , as between the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Federal Police
          </a>
          and the executive, as we discussed, I think, a year ago. Obviously, there have been other matters since that time that have reminded certainly opposition senators, but I would say all in this place, of the importance of ensuring that parliamentary privilege for all senators is protected.

              make a statement now from the chair. The protection of parliamentary privilege and private information of members and senators is paramount in managing the security and data systems in Parliament House. This resolution restates that. The evolving security environment has required changes to operations in this building—some before my time in this role, and some on my watch. Due to previous events, I understand there remains a sensitivity around some of these elements which has underpinned the consultation and work I have undertaken overseeing their implementation and management.
             </p>
             <p>
              This resolution is the product of these developments and discussions and will put in place an interim arrangement that will allow the activation of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EAC" rel="nofollow">
               EAC

              system. It also encompasses the review of the operation of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
               CCTV
              </a>
              system that will be undertaken in coming months and that will engage

              </a>
              , specifically to consider the CCTV code of practice and its protection of privilege. It also restates the prioritisation of the renegotiation of the arrangements with the executive regarding the protection of parliamentary privilege, which is also a personal priority of mine for the coming year.
             </p>
             <p>
              Senators should remain confident that the protection of privilege and the security of private information of senators remains my highest priority. I understand the other place either has recently dealt with or will very soon be dealing with a motion in very similar terms. I'd like to thank all senators who engaged constructively with me and officials in dealing with these matters.
