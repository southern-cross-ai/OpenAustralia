        My question is to Senator Coonan, Minister for Communications,

         Information Technology
        </a>
        and the Arts. Is the minister aware of a recently released book,
        <i>
         Sex Lives of Australian Teenagers
        </i>
        , that states that 65 per cent of boys and 50 per cent of girls have seen internet pornography by the age of 12? Is the minister aware that it is now nearly eight months since the government announced that it would give away filters to families to protect children from internet pornography? Can the minister now confirm that not one Australian family has received access to an internet filter under her proposal?

         Thank you to Senator Polley for her question. I think it is fair to say that it is a very difficult issue and I thank the senator for raising it in the chamber today, particularly because it is a day when question time is broadcast around Australia and we are able to reach many parents and carers. It is a very important issue. I know that everyone in this chamber supports me and supports our government when I say that child pornography is an unmitigated evil, and I would hope that there would be absolutely no argument about that. This is an issue that I would hope is above politics, and I put on record the support of my colleagues from all sides in working to stop the sexual trade and trafficking of children.

         -based filters or a subsidised filtered internet service for Australian families and funding to allow every public library in Australia to set up child-safe internet terminals will be operational this year. It certainly is a priority within my portfolio. A comprehensive national community education campaign will be undertaken to raise awareness of the National Filter Scheme and provide detailed information for parents about how they can access free filters and general internet safety information.

            It is important that everyone in this chamber supports the efforts to get this filter organised, and that is exactly what is happening. I think it is quite appalling that anyone would actually suggest that this government has not taken efforts to ensure that this very pernicious thing is addressed. Through the online content scheme, which the government established in 2000, any Australian can make a complaint about material, and I certainly urge Senator Polley to make complaints about any offensive material of which she is aware on the internet. The complaint is then investigated as a priority by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Communications_and_Media_Authority" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Communications and Media Authority
            </a>
            , the online body. If it is found to be a breach of classification standards administered by the Attorney-General, the image can be taken down immediately or the host faces significant penalty sanctions.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, if the regulator considers that the content is sufficiently serious it must also notify the Australian police force. In relation to prohibited content hosted outside Australia, which is the case with certain websites like
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube" rel="nofollow">
             YouTube
            </a>
            and MySpace, the regulator,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
             ACMA
            </a>
            , must notify the filter vendor so they can add it to their list of sites to be blocked. There are a number of measures that I do not have time to go into, but this government is serious that this is incredibly important and we are making serious efforts and putting a great deal of money towards addressing this problem in an emerging and difficult area.

             , I ask a supplementary question. Thank you, Minister, for attempting to answer the question, but the question was how many families have actually benefited from the policy announcement over eight months ago? Hasn’t the minister’s policy of promoting end-user internet filters failed to protect children from dangerous and disturbing internet pornography? Why hasn’t the government done all it can to protect Australian children from exposure to harmful internet content? Does the minister now admit that the government must adopt Labor’s policy and require internet service providers to block access to this repugnant material? Minister, can you confirm how many families have actually accessed your program.

On three occasions, both in the original and supplementary question, the minister has been asked to tell the Senate how many Australian families have received access to an internet filter under her proposals. We have asked; Senator Polley deserves an answer to the question. If it is zero, why don’t you tell us?
