        My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz. Will the minister update the Senate on how the government's reform agenda will strengthen the Australian economy and create jobs?

         I thank Senator Johnston for that very important question. Everything this government does is about building a strong and prosperous economy, one that is growing jobs and strengthening communities. Australia is now one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Since the coalition was elected, 336,000 jobs have been created in Australia. The job creation rate is more than four times the rate seen in the last year of Labor in 2013. But there is more work to be done. That is why the government are setting about cutting red tape. That is why we have introduced the $20,000 small-business tax write-off. It is why the government are investing more than $50 billion in infrastructure, creating jobs during the construction phase and helping to enhance jobs and productivity for Australia's long-term prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is why the government is negotiating free trade agreements. A recent report estimates that the China, Japan and Korea trade deals will create thousands of jobs.

             Whilst we concentrate on revitalising and growing the Australian economy, we understand the need for programs to ensure that each cohort of job seeker is supported to find and keep a job. For job-ready job seekers, the new jobactive employment service links job seekers with employers to get the right job seekers into the right jobs.

            <p>
             For older Australians, the Restart program offers employers who take on mature age job seekers a generous $10,000 support payment. For job seekers who want to move to take up a job, the government provides a relocation assistance scheme of up to $6,000; and for young Australians the $330 million Youth Employment Strategy will help to improve their job prospects.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition, work for the dole is giving job seekers the opportunity to learn new skills whilst giving back to the community that supports them. All of our employment programs are designed to—

               The best way to create jobs is to build a strong and prosperous economy that promotes workforce participation, productivity and jobs growth. For example, the government is seeking to enhance productivity and jobs growth within the Australian construction sector. The return of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the associated building code will restore the rule of law and reduce delays that cost jobs growth in the construction sector. Our building code will significantly reduce cost blow-outs on large construction building projects—money which could be better spent on other projects that would create even more jobs and even better amenities for our fellow Australians.
