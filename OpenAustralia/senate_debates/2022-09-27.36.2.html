           That's a pity! I thank Senator Paterson for his question. Obviously, I've just come back from the

            UN
           </a>
           General Assembly, so I haven't been in Australia for the events to which he refers. I think Senator Watt is probably more across what has occurred while I've been away, and I think he was asked questions yesterday about this. This is an occasion where it does appear, if I may say so, that the lack of action by the previous government has come home to roost. When you look at, for example, the privacy commissioner's comments—

               If only it were so easy that the failure to govern properly could be simply dismissed in that way. The reality is: you failed to act on so many issues, including the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act" rel="nofollow">
                Privacy Act
               </a>
               , and in relation to cybersecurity more broadly. As a consequence of the previous government's failures on this front, Australia is less prepared for and less resilient to cyberattacks than we should have been. You would know that, Senator Paterson, because you are one of the people on that side who understands some of the issues of national security and some of the complexity. You would know that the previous government did not pay sufficient attention to this issue. You would know, for example, that there were recommendations made, which the privacy commissioner has talked about, to strengthen the regulatory framework to provide additional rights for Australians to protect their personal information, and it does not appear that they were acted upon.

                 A point of order on relevance: in response to Senator Paterson's point of order before, you indicated the minister was just beginning her response. When he drew a point of order that the question was related to statements about this particular cyberattack and which of those statements was correct, the minister went on talking about the former government. You indicated she was beginning her answer and gave her some latitude, but now, with 12 seconds left, I ask you to draw the minister to the question.

I find it hard to believe that you come into this place, Senator Paterson, and are concerned about the minister saying that, when it's self-evidently the fact that the data has been stolen. The data has been stolen, and the government has been working, including with Optus, to try and resolve what has occurred with this data breach. But I think it is an odd thing to do, to come into this chamber and try to play politics on the basis—

                              As part of the response to the cyberattack, will the government expedite passport applications and waive fees of Optus customers whose passport details may have been compromised in this data leak?

                               That is a good question and I should say that obviously the situation is evolving and the government is considering how we respond to identified risks such as the one you have outlined. Regrettably, this occurs at a time when we already have a lot of pressure in the passport system as a consequence of the previous government's failure to plan for the massive spike in passport applications that occurred because people didn't renew whilst the borders were closed. I think I've been up-front with the public, and Assistant Minister Watts has been up-front with the public, about how we are trying to resolve that issue. But that is an issue that will take time, and we are still dealing with unprecedented demand, and this comes at a time when the system is already under pressure.
