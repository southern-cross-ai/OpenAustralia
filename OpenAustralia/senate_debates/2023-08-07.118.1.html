        CCONE (—) (): My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. Minister, I heard on Friday your announcement, together with the Minister for Trade and Tourism, that the pathway to negotiating with China to remove duties on Australian barley has led to a successful outcome. Given the government has also restarted constructive dialogue with China while maintaining our strategic settings and protecting our national security, can the minister please advise on Australia's current approach to our relationship with China and the progress that has been made in stabilising the bilateral relationship?

         Thank you to Senator Ciccone not only for his question but for his deep interest in Australian foreign policy and Australia's place in the world. We welcome the decision by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRC" rel="nofollow">
          PRC
         </a>
         to remove the 80.5 per cent antidumping and countervailing duties on Australian barley. This is the right outcome for Australian producers and the right outcome for Chinese consumers. It affirms the calm and consistent approach that the Albanese government has taken. The removal of these duties is the result of work by government and industry to resolve this matter, working through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization" rel="nofollow">
          World Trade Organization
         </a>
         . I acknowledge the work done by ministerial colleagues, particularly the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell, and their offices. I acknowledge the work of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         and a number of other government departments, including Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the Albanese government was elected, we have said we will take a calm and consistent approach to foreign policy. We will renew our relationships, we will engage in the region and we will make sure we fully engage in the multilateral system. This includes seeking to stabilise the bilateral relationship with China. We have always said we believe this is in both countries' interests. We have also been clear that our national interests and strategic settings have not changed. In the past year, I've had the opportunity to have a number of constructive meetings with my Chinese counterparts, the Prime Minister has met with President Xi and other ministers from our government continue to engage in a way that serves the interests of Australia and Australians. As we have said, when it comes to our relationship with China, we will cooperate where we can, we will disagree where we must and we will engage in our national interest. We will continue to speak out as necessary on the issues that matter to Australians, including human rights, consular cases and, of course, trade issues.

                Thank you, Senator Ciccone. I acknowledge and thank the industry and affected businesses for their support and their patience throughout this
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO" rel="nofollow">
                 WTO
                </a>
                process. Australia would not have been able to reach this outcome without first pursuing our dispute through the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization" rel="nofollow">
                 World Trade Organization
                </a>
                . It is a key element of the international rules and norms to which Australia is committed, ensuring that all members, regardless of economic weight or size, are able to hold other countries to account when rules have not been respected. While the WTO encourages bilateral resolution to disputes, its mandate is what draws countries to the bilateral negotiating table.
               </p>
               <p>
                We know that countries want a prosperous and connected region, trading with transparency and predictability, where economic interdependence is not misused for political and strategic ends. The Australian government, the Albanese government, will continue to work within that system to stand up for the rights of Australian exporters and seek to resolve differences over trade matters.

                   The Albanese government has renewed Australia's closest relationships and also our commitment to the multilateral system. What we have left behind, what we have left in the past, is the approach, from Mr Morrison and Mr Dutton, of picking international fights to create a domestic headline. What we've left in the past are the attacks on international institutions that actually enhance our sovereignty—remember negative globalism from the other side. We are working with our partners and with international institutions to advance Australia's interests. Not only is that achieving progress, as we've seen with barley; it also changes the way the countries of the region look to us. It enhances Australia's reputation as a responsible and reliable partner. It makes us stronger and more influential in the world. As our region and our world become more complex and challenging, we are deploying all elements of our national power to shape a region in our interests—one that is open, stable and prosperous and one in which sovereignty is respected.
