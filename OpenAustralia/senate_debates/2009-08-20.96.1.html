        My question is to the Minister for Defence and the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Faulkner. Can the minister update the Senate on the conduct of the elections in Afghanistan? Can the minister inform the Senate of the role played by troops to ensure the safe conduct of the election?

         All senators would be aware that today Afghanistan is going to the polls for its presidential and provincial elections. Polling booths opened some two hours ago. This is the first Afghan run election for 30 years. It is a tribute to the determination of the Afghan people who are holding these elections and providing the security for people wanting to vote, with the assistance of

         says that election campaigning has been robust and vibrant, that 31 candidates are running for president and approximately 3,300 people, including 342 women, have registered as candidates in the provincial council elections. In Oruzgan province ADF personnel have been involved in a number of operations to create secure conditions for the poll. In fact Australia has deployed an extra 120 combat troops to provide that security. Prior to polling day, Australian troops conducted patrols and security operations in the Chora Valley, Dihrawud and

         regions, operations which have severely disrupted Taliban networks, which threaten the safe conduct of the polls. Taliban insurgents have issued multiple threats to disrupt election proceedings. This is a difficult and challenging day for our troops and of course for the Afghan people. I am sure that the wishes of all senators are with them as these elections proceed.

          , I ask a supplementary and I thank the minister for his answer. Can the minister indicate what steps have been taken to maximize the participation of women in the elections? Is there a risk that the results of the Afghanistan election will be considered less legitimate because of difficulties with the participation of women?

           Yes, I am aware of reports that there may be shortages in the number of women officials to assist with the elections. Australia has provided extensive support for the elections, including the training of some 200 female Afghan election observers to allow women to participate in elections. Access to voting stations should be available to at least 85 per cent of Afghanistan’s 16 million registered voters and this includes dedicated polling stations for women. I am encouraged that among the new registered voters some 39 per cent are women.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the threats of intimation by Taliban extremists and the series of recent attacks in the heart of Kabul and elsewhere, can there be any assurance regarding election security and turnout?

             ’s chief of the election taskforce, Australian Brigadier Damian Cantwell, who has been overseeing election security, expects about 6,500 polling stations to open and 85 to 90 per cent of Afghan voters to be able to vote, with only those in Taliban dominated areas unable to vote. There is no doubt that Taliban intimidation will reduce this turnout. However, the security arrangements in place and the domestic and international support which has been provided will minimise the disruption and protect the Afghan people as they exercise their democratic right. With ISAF troops in support of the
