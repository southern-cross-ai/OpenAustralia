        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Senator McKenzie. Last night, Minister, Senator Davey told the Senate:

       <p class="italic">
        … I facilitated a meeting today between members of the convoy and the Minister for

        When did the minister first become aware of the meeting between irrigators, irrigation farmers, community members and business people with Ministers Littleproud and Ley?

         Thank you very much, Senator Sterle. I became aware of that meeting when Senator Davey shared that with me earlier on this week. That has been something she has been working on as part of living, working, raising a family and running a business in the southern basin as a rice grower. She has been a strong advocate for irrigation communities. I would recommend that everyone in the Senate tune into the adjournment speech she gave last night, which spoke to the impact of the drought on these communities; the work that our government has done to assist farmers and their communities who are struggling with a lack of water; and her desire to see mutually beneficial outcomes between people who have concerns about the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, the state government's role, the water-sharing arrangements and, indeed, federal government policy. Hats off to Senator Davey for a fantastic meeting. I know that each and every one of our backbenchers here are continually raising issues with ministers, making sure that they broker meetings with their constituents and stakeholders in their respective states and areas of interest. That's called being in government and assisting your constituents to get things done.

            Well, there are a lot of meetings that happen, Senator Sterle. I'm not invited to a lot of them, as is the defence minister not invited to a lot of them, as is the minister for skills not invited to a lot of them et cetera. I'm the Minister for Agriculture. I'm involved in stakeholder meetings to do with the agriculture portfolio. The Minister for

            and Emergency Management, who is also responsible for the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, is the absolutely appropriate minister to be conducting that meeting, as is Minister Ley, who has responsibilities for the Commonwealth water holder.
