         My thanks to Senator Grogan for her question. I appreciate her ongoing concern over the crisis unfolding in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         . We have seen a devastating loss of innocent life since the heinous attacks on Israel by the brutal terrorist group Hamas. We continue to call for the unconditional release of all hostages.
        </p>
        <p>
         Colleagues, the scenes from the explosion at a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City" rel="nofollow">
          Gaza City
         </a>
         hospital overnight are deeply distressing. As the Prime Minister said this morning, every innocent life matters whether Israeli or Palestinian. Our thoughts are with those killed, with those injured and their loved ones. The protection of civilians wherever they live must come first and respect for international humanitarian law is paramount. We condemn any indiscriminate attacks and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including hospitals. Australia joins with others in calling for international law to always be upheld.
        </p>
        <p>
         The humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate, and we reiterate our call for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza. We support the establishment of a corridor to enable humanitarian needs to be met and to ensure the $10 million in humanitarian assistance we have announced reaches those who need it. We are encouraging the work of the United States, Egypt and others towards this goal.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I told this place earlier this week, our calls for international humanitarian law to be respected are about protecting innocent life. But they are also about our shared interests. They are about containing this conflict—and containing this conflict matters. If conflict were to spill over across the region, risks to Israel's security would be compounded, as they would for Israeli and Palestinian civilians and civilian populations throughout the region. Averting regional escalation matters to Israel. It matters to the people of the region and it matters to the world.

            Last night an Australian government assisted departure flight landed in Sydney from Dubai, carrying 222 passengers, and 164 of those were Australian citizens. It was wonderful to see Australians reunited with their families at the airport. An Australian government assisted departure flight is due to land in Sydney from London today, and, subject to security conditions, we are planning an assisted departure flight from

            . This includes supporting Australians in the

            on departure options, such as transport to Jordan with our international partners and accommodation. Australians in the West Bank who want to leave should contact the Consular Emergency Centre. More than 1,500 previously registered Australians have now left Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

               Thank you, Senator Grogan. Since the beginning of this crisis, the government has updated the Australian government travel advice for neighbouring Lebanon. As I said on the weekend, we are urging Australians in Lebanon to consider whether the need for them to remain there is essential. I urge that again today. If Australians in Lebanon do wish to leave, they should be aware that a crisis could limit commercial departure options. If they want to leave, we encourage them to take the first available option. The areas of Lebanon bordering Israel,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights" rel="nofollow">
                Golan Heights
               </a>
               and Syria remain at level 4, 'Do not travel.' Other areas of Lebanon remain at level 3, 'Reconsider your need to travel.' This means Australians should avoid non-essential travel. Please access the latest travel advice on the Smartraveller website. Australians who need emergency consular assistance should contact the Consular Emergency Centre.

                <p>
                 I will seek further advice, but my recollection is that a call was requested after the attack. My recollection is that, when I last spoke to the Prime Minister's office about this, the call had not yet been scheduled. Obviously, there has been a lot of engagement with the Israeli government, in particular via the ambassador.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I would make this point, and I would encourage all in this place to heed the words of Mr Burgess about the importance of handling issues sensitively, particularly at this time and particularly given the events overnight. We know, as I said when this motion was being debated, this is an issue about which some in Australia's community feel very deeply. We know that there are strongly held different views in our community. We know it is important that all Australians, regardless of their views on this issue, do feel that they are not being excluded and that their perspective and their experience are something that those in leadership positions, those in this parliament, are aware of. I would continue to urge there to be a mature, measured, bipartisan approach to these issues, given the sensitivity of these matters within the Australian community.

                   , Mr Netanyahu, was a phone call on 4 August 2022 and a letter on 5 January this year. Since then, has the Prime Minister, Prime Minister Albanese, had any further contact with Israel's Prime Minister, and, if so, what has been the nature of those points of contacts?

                    I can advise in relation to the primary question. I can confirm a call was sought on Sunday formally, which was obviously very soon after the attack. We are yet to receive a confirmed time for a call from the Israeli government, which is perfectly understandable given the circumstances Israel is facing.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I would say to you, Senator, that obviously the Prime Minister has, as have I, engaged with members of the Jewish community and the ambassador of Israel. I know the Prime Minister has engaged with the ambassador personally. I would also indicate, as I did earlier in the week, that, consistent with our view that escalation or spillover of this conflict is neither in Israel's interest nor in civilians' interests across this region, we have reached out to governments of the region to express that view.

                       I would make the point, in terms of that list, that obviously, with the relevant members of the P5 and others who have more direct engagement with the region, we would want to support very much their engagement and their work, for the reasons I outlined. Our focus here is on what it is we can do from afar. Well, we've had a number of focuses, obviously—bringing home those Australians who needed assistance to come home. We have done that, and I do thank all those who were involved in doing so. I thank Senator O'Neill, who was there when people arrived because I wasn't able to attend. Thank you for that work.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The second focus has been to try and do what we can to prevent this conflict escalating.

                         First, in relation to Gaza, we have seen devastating loss of innocent lives since the attacks on Israel by Hamas. I would again say the scenes from the explosion at
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City" rel="nofollow">
                          Gaza City
                         </a>
                         hospital are deeply distressing and it is clear there has been a devastating loss of life. We should all continue to assert that every innocent life matters, whether Israeli or Palestinian, and we should extend, obviously, our deepest sympathies to all killed, those injured and their loved ones. There are obviously conflicting reports about what has occurred.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         What I would say, Senator—and you would be aware from my comments from day one and my speech to this chamber in relation to the motion which was passed—we recognise Israel's right to defend itself. What I have also said is that how Israel conducts this conflict matters. I have also consistently—as have the United States and, yesterday, the United Kingdom—called for the observance of international law. We have consistently said that civilian lives should be protected. This is a very distressing and difficult situation, and it is important that Australia continues to assert the position that really we have always asserted, as a matter of principle, which is that we urge the protection of civilian lives.

                            I would refer to my previous answer. We believe that Israel has a right to defend itself.
