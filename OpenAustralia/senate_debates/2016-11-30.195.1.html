        (DAWR) has focussed its resources on Mexico's highest market access request priority which is table grapes. DAWR released the draft report for the non-regulated analysis of existing policy for table grapes from Sonora, Mexico, on 13 January 2016 for a 30 day stakeholder consultation period. The draft report and related documents are available on the DAWR's website. Five submissions were received on the draft report, including from Mexico's National Plant Protection Organisation and four Australian state government agriculture departments (

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As work is ongoing for Mexico's highest priority import risk analysis request, in addition to work on priority import requests from other key markets, work is not being conducted on avocados or limes at this time. Once table grape considerations are finalised, next priorities will be considered in consultation with Mexico.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes the Committee's recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has already put in place all of the regulatory framework needed for direct flights to commence between Australia and Mexico. It is now up to airlines to make commercial assessments as to whether to commence direct flights.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Specifically, air services with Mexico are enabled by a treaty-level
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Services_Agreement" rel="nofollow">
         Air Services Agreement
        </a>
        signed in 2010. Under current air services arrangements, airlines can operate direct flights between Australia and Mexico.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As the legal framework is already in place, the Government considers that a decision to operate direct air services between Australia and Mexico is one to be made by airlines based on commercial imperatives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While there are currently no direct air services between Australia and Mexico, both Qantas and Virgin Australia have code-share arrangements on flights between the United States and Mexico.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mexican passport holders can apply online for a Visitor visa (subclass 600), and have been able to do so since May 2014.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Visitor" rel="nofollow">
         The Visitor
        </a>
        visa allows people to visit Australia for both tourism or business visitor purposes, and its validity period can be longer than the eVisitor (subclass 651).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Immigration and Border Protection is also, as part of a broad, strategic review of the visa framework, considering ways in which the Visitor visa framework could be improved for all nationalities in the long-term, including Mexico. It is, however, unlikely that additional countries will be added to the eVisitor eligibility list as a result of this review.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports this recommendation and wishes to advise the Committee that measures along these lines are already being undertaken.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In respect of risks regarding security, prior to travelling to Mexico Australians are strongly encouraged to read the travel advice provided on the Smartraveller website by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

        . It is recommended that all overseas travel, including to Mexico, be registered on Smartraveller.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Providing practical and timely information to Australian businesses regarding business conditions in Mexico including security and corruption issues is a priority for Austrade. In order to do this effectively Austrade maintains a number of valuable local relationships with key risk consultants including Control Risks, Emerging Markets Political Risk Analysis (EMPRA) and the major accounting firms. In addition, Austrade regularly consults with the independent think-tank, the Mexican Institute for Competition (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMCO" rel="nofollow">
         IMCO
        </a>
        ) on a range of 'rule of law' issues.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , maintain regular contact with Australian industry bodies, relevant chambers of commerce, State and Territory Governments, and other stakeholders to raise awareness of opportunities and challenges in the Mexican market and to dispel any unfounded concerns. A range of social networks (including Facebook and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn" rel="nofollow">
         LinkedIn
        </a>
        ) are also utilised to communicate major developments in Mexico.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reports, such as 'Mexico: Gateway to the Americas', which was released in February 2016 by the Export Council of Australia will also assist to raise awareness of the risks and rewards of conducting business in Mexico. Previous governments have also sought to raise business awareness of Mexico. For example, as long ago as 2002 the Council on Australia-

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government accepts this recommendation in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In Australia, the recognition of overseas qualifications for study and employment purposes is decentralised. Each education institution and professional recognition authority establishes its own policies and processes for qualifications recognition, including the establishment of mutual recognition arrangements. Professional and industry bodies, registration and licensing authorities, state and territory governments and employers are responsible for the recognition of overseas qualifications for employment purposes, which usually involves the assessment of overseas qualifications and skills against the standards required for employment in the relevant occupation in Australia. The recognition of overseas qualifications for study purposes is under the remit of Australian education institutions which are autonomous entities that determine their own policies for admission and recognition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will continue to work through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Education and Training
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DET" rel="nofollow">
         DET
        </a>
        ) with recognition organisations to have transparent, equitable and timely assessment arrangements in place. DET will continue to provide information and support services through the Country Education Profiles (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEP" rel="nofollow">
         CEP
        </a>
        s), an online qualification recognition tool designed to help relevant authorities to recognise overseas higher education and postsecondary technical and vocational educational qualifications. These profiles provide non-binding information on the comparability of overseas qualifications from around 130 countries, including Mexico.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommendations" rel="nofollow">
         Recommendations
        </a>
        on the comparability of overseas qualifications are based on in-depth analysis of a range of quantitative and qualitative education indicators.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        DET has also committed additional resources to expanding education cooperation with Mexico. In August 2014, DET appointed an Education and Science Counsellor to Latin America. This led to the signing of a new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_Understanding" rel="nofollow">
         Memorandum of Understanding
        </a>
        in Education, Research and Training in April 2015 with Mexico, and a joint education committee is being established.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Activities undertaken and underway with Mexico to increase mutual understanding and awareness of qualifications frameworks and recognition arrangements include:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The first meeting of the joint working group and agreement on joint activities will both take place in 2016. Work will include building on the qualification framework and recognition activities already undertaken as well as joint activities to support greater cooperation in education between Australia and Mexico.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government also places considerable importance on bilateral, regional and multilateral trade negotiations, with free trade agreements such as Trans-Pacific Partnership providing opportunities to deepen engagement in education and training between countries like Australia and Mexico. These agreements are also valuable in supporting the recognition of qualifications internationally and can play a role in providing trained professionals with more transparent and predictable operating conditions in overseas labour markets.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports this recommendation and wishes to advise the Committee that measures along these lines are already being undertaken.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The promotion of Australian vocational education and training (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
         VET
        </a>
        ) services is a priority for Austrade's office in Mexico, along with the recruitment of Mexican students for study in Australian institutions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Austrade's overarching strategy across Latin America is to position Australia's research, education and training expertise in specific sectors such as energy, mining, agri-food, water and health—sectors that are a priority for governments in the region and in which Australia has world-leading capability not just in human capital development but also across equipment, technology and services. In Mexico, opportunities in the advanced manufacturing sector are also relevant.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Austrade's office in Mexico has identified significant demand for skilled workers and for industry-led competency-based training systems, and is exploring opportunities for Australian VET providers to be involved in the delivery of training using Trans National Education (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNE" rel="nofollow">

This mission is scheduled to take place in the final quarter of this financial year with the support of Austrade's office in Mexico. It follows a previous visit in 2014 by

        The Government notes the Committee's recommendation.

        The New
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo_Plan" rel="nofollow">
         Colombo Plan
        </a>
        is a signature initiative of the Government that aims to lift knowledge of the Indo-Pacific in Australia by supporting Australian undergraduates to study and undertake professional experiences in the region. It was inspired by Australia's experience under the original Colombo Plan, where over a 30 year period, thousands of students from neighbouring countries came to study in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia's geographic region is the focus of the New Colombo Plan as it is crucial to Australia's future economic, trade and diplomatic interests. The 38 current eligible study locations, encompassing

        countries, provide a strong and coherent regional focus for the program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The New Colombo Plan is still at a relatively early stage of implementation and 2015 was the first year of the full roll-out of the program. Student numbers are still scaling up. The Government is of the view that it is preferable to embed the program in its current form before considering major changes, including to the geographic scope of the program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the same time the Government is committed to increasing the number of Australian students studying overseas globally and continues to make a significant investment in supporting undergraduate, postgraduate and vocational education and training (VET) students to study overseas, through Endeavour Mobility Grants.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government, through the Department of Education and Training (DET) offers three programs that support student mobility to Mexico which provide short-term study for Australian VET students, short-term and semester study for Australian higher education students, and semester study for students from Mexico (to study in Australia).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not accept this recommendation.
       </p>

        Presently, there are three panel sites in Mexico that conduct immigration medical examinations for Australia-bound clients including Mexico City, Guadalajara and

        Each panel site comprises panel physicians and radiologists and is deemed to have sufficient capacity to undertake additional cases, particularly during the student peak periods as well as utilising locum panel doctors during peak periods. No delays in appointments are currently experienced with all clients being seen generally within a few days and the ability to take same day appointments if urgent.

        Historically panel services were provided in three other locations: Mexicali, Merida and Monterrey. However, the low volumes in these sites (for instance before removal in 2012 Monterrey undertook only five medicals in a six month period) meant quality standards were not complied with and significant concerns arose around integrity issues. To maintain standards a minimum number of medicals is required which is deemed to be at least 150 per doctor per annum. Furthermore Australia utilises an eMedical platform that is costly for panel physicians to have in place and each additional panel member raises the support costs for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.

        It was the view of the Committee that the Government's response to the Inquiry's recommendations should wait until the finalisation of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority investigation into allegations of doping in Australia's professional sports.
