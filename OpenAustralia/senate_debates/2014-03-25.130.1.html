        Arthritis is a common condition affecting three million people across Australia of all ages and from all walks of life. These three million Australians are affected by 120 different types of arthritis, each impacting on people in different ways but all frequently resulting in reduced mobility and joint stiffness. It is these facts that Arthritis
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness_Week" rel="nofollow">
         Awareness Week
        </a>
        seeks to highlight. Arthritis Awareness Week is held annually—this year from 23 to 30 March—to educate and inform Australians and to start a discussion on the support that is currently available to help people with arthritis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday the Parliamentary Friends of Arthritis were able to join Arthritis Australia at the launch of 'Time to Move', a national strategy to reduce a costly burden. In launching this strategy the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Arthritis Australia, Ainslie Cahill, stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Arthritis is one of the most common, costly and disabling chronic conditions in the country and comes with a bill for the health and welfare system of more than $5 billion a year. This is in addition to an annual loss of $9.4 billion in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        caused by early retirement due to arthritis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ms Cahill went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But we know that much of the pain and disability caused by arthritis could be prevented or reduced by providing better care for people as early as possible in the disease course. This helps to keep people with arthritis in work and living life to the full. This is what Time to Move is addressing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Time to Move sets out a strategy for improving care from childhood onwards for people with arthritis—specifically osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile arthritis. At the launch that I attended last night, we heard from people affected by each of these three types of arthritis. Former Wallaby Damian Smith spoke of being diagnosed with osteoarthritis in 2011, after many years of suffering symptoms, of the lifestyle changes that led to his diagnosis and the steps he now takes to manage his condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ms Wendy Favorito spoke of her experience of living with rheumatoid arthritis for 37 years, having been diagnosed at the age of six. Wendy spoke about the struggles she faces every day, her great determination to continue in a career that she loves and the great support of her young children.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, I am sure that all those who attended the event will agree that the most impactful speech came from Patrick McHarg and his mother, Sarah. Patrick is 11 years old. Not only did he attend and speak at the launch of Arthritis Australia's event but he also fronted his very first media conference, which, he told me, was very exciting. Patrick told his audience that he loves playing rugby league and loves the

        </a>
        . When he grows up he wants to be a football player or a pilot in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        . Patrick is a pretty normal kid, except that he has juvenile arthritis. Patrick was diagnosed with arthritis when he was six years old after months of doctor's visits, X-rays, ultrasounds, blood tests,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAT" rel="nofollow">

        s and two knee operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Patrick's mother, Sarah, said that, after months of not knowing why her once healthy son was getting sicker before her eyes, she was relieved when they were finally given a label for what Patrick had. Now, with the gift of hindsight, Sarah says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I was naive, I thought arthritis was a condition that people like my Grandma got, I was so wrong.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a misconception about arthritis that all too many people have. Patrick shared with us his experience of living with juvenile arthritis, and I quote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I missed a lot of school because my knees wouldn't start feeling better until lunch-time and my Mum and Dad took turns taking time off work to be home with me.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For a long time I couldn't play in the playground at school, I got really sad because I couldn't play soccer or football with my friends at recess and lunchtime and I had to spend all my time in the library. I missed out on a lot: parties, sports carnivals, play dates, a lot of school and a couple of seasons of football.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I don't like that I am different to other kids.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether you are persuaded by facts and figures or these personal stories of the daily challenges of living with arthritis, it is clear that it is time to move on arthritis. We cannot afford not to.
