        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. I refer to an article this morning on the front page of the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        newspaper regarding a member of the Referendum Working Group,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mayo" rel="nofollow">
         Thomas Mayo
        </a>
        . Does the Prime Minister endorse Mr Mayo's comment that the power of the Voice to Parliament was its ability to 'punish' elected members of this parliament that ignored its advice on funding and legislation?

         The Prime Minister and the government have made his and its views clear about why the Voice matters. As was discussed in great detail and at great length on Friday evening and Friday night and the early hours of Saturday morning, the Voice is about two things. It's about recognition of Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         people in our Constitution and it's about listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on matters that affect them. We've been clear about the principles associated with that. It does ensure that the Voice will give independent advice to the parliament and the government. The minister representing has gone through the principles, which I can read out again and I think were read out on many occasions in the committee stage and elsewhere in the debate.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would make the point, Senator Hanson, that I understand what your position is. I thought it was made very clear this morning. I disagree with it, but—

             What I was trying to say, Senator Hanson, is: I understand the position you have, which is to oppose. I take a different view, as do the senators on this side. The Prime Minister's position is the position that has been outlined by the government minister responding in the Senate, over and over again. We've gone into great detail about how the Voice will operate and the fact that it will not have a veto power and will not have a program delivery function. Others can choose to articulate this how they wish. The government will choose to articulate our view about how the Voice will work. The advice will be independent, and it will be chosen by Aboriginal and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
              Torres Strait Islander
             </a>
             people. It will be representative. It will be empowering, community led, inclusive, respectful and culturally informed. It will be accountable and transparent. It will work alongside existing structures, and it will not have a veto power.

               As usual, you have failed to answer the question. Do you endorse it or not? I got no answer out of you. Will the Prime Minister rule out establishing seats in this parliament reserved exclusively for

                In relation to the second question, that's not something that the government is proposing and it's not something that the government took to the last election. We took, very clearly, to the last election a Voice to the parliament, and we are seeking to deliver on that mandate. In relation to your first question, I appreciate that you don't like my answer, but I am entitled to give you the answer that I believe is correct in response to your question.

                  In other words, you're not ruling out the fact that there could be Indigenous-only seats in this parliament. My question is: will the Prime Minister rule out the establishment of an independent, sovereign Aboriginal and

                  state in Australia if the Voice makes a representation demanding it? You want the Voice to Parliament. If they asked you the question, would you actually consider an independent Indigenous state?
