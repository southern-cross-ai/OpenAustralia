        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for

        , Minister Gallagher. The government's first legislative change following the referendum is the offshore worker safety bill, in which schedule 2, part 2, gives the Minister for Resources the power to silence

         First Nations

        voices who are fighting to protect their sea country, including sea country that might be part of the Indigenous protected areas, the IPAs. Australia also signed the high seas treaty in September last year, which sets out new obligations regarding marine protected areas on the high seas. My question is: are areas of sea country in IPAs exempt from offshore leases, and will they be included in any protected areas established or managed under the high seas treaty?

         I thank Senator Cox for the question about the offshore gas safety legislation. We've certainly, I think, had feedback from a whole range of organisations, including environmental organisations and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         groups, along with the industry, who have told the government that our system of consultation is not working, which is why we are developing those amendments to the legislation. There will be further amendments, as I understand it, that will be moved in the House. We need to make sure that those regulatory changes will be consistent with our national environmental laws.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think this is probably a question better asked of the Minister for Resources rather than the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         . But we are aware, certainly in the consultations around this bill, of feedback from First Nations groups, and ministers, including the Minister for Resources, Minister King, have been doing the consultations around that legislation. So my advice is that there will be no changes to rigorous environmental assessments, no environmental standards will be watered down and there will be no fast track for offshore projects, but this bill will allow some reform to improve the safety of offshore gas workers and to fix the broken community consultation process on offshore projects where we have had feedback from those numerous stakeholders, including First Nations groups.

           What's the point in having these protected areas if the government will not commit to protecting these areas from the drilling, against the wishes of

            I'm not sure whether senators have been aware of it, but there have been amendments moved in the House to better capture the government's longstanding intention to maintain the integrity of our environmental and community protection regime. I'll just refer you back to my earlier answer, where I said that the bill—

               My advice has been that the bill does not change the legal requirements for offshore consultation in any way, shape or form, so I think that does answer that question. There'll be no changes to rigorous environmental assessments, no environmental standards will be watered down and there will be no fast track for offshore projects involved or covered by this legislation. There have been some amendments moved which I think better capture that focus, and there are the consultations that Minister King has done to date.

                  The government doesn't ignore anybody or any stakeholder. In fact, we have made it part of our government's priority to consult across the board and to consult widely on legislation and policies, because this government is about bringing people together, not dividing them. We are a very different government to the one that came before us and very different to the opposition that sits there and opposes everything—no new ideas, negativity all the way.

                    It is strange, I accept, Senator Rennick, because you're not a great bringer-together of people, but this is the approach that we take here. We want to consult with people.

                       President, I'm sure that Senator Gallagher will withdraw if Senator Rennick wishes her to, but I don't think he markets himself as the consensus guy. I thought it was in good nature, but, if the senator wishes Senator Gallagher to withdraw, I'm sure she will.

                        I withdraw. I was responding to the interjections that were occurring, but I withdraw. But we don't ignore stakeholders on projects. The approach we take is that ministers work with stakeholders. If there are areas where we disagree, we explain why we disagree, but, on this one, Minister King is leading those consultations.
