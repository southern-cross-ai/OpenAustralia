           I am very pleased to be able to outline the details of the agreement with the coalition. The agreement is as follows: the Greens have had a longstanding position to see Senate voting reform implemented. We put that to the government, and the government agreed.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is interesting, though: I have another agreement here. It is an agreement from 2010, and it is an agreement with the Labor Party. In fact, it is a written agreement. And in that written agreement we have a commitment from the Labor Party to support the Greens policy of campaign finance reform—political donations reform: lowering the disclosure threshold, prevention of donation splitting and preventing foreign donations. In fact, there is also an agreement to reform electoral voting in the Senate.
          </p>
          <p>
           When it comes to a written agreement, we have the Labor Party walking away from the agreement on Senate voting reform and on campaign finance reform. The Labor Party need to recognise that their enemies are over there, not over here.

              I note that in saying so, neither the Greens nor the government have actually provided the full detail of this agreement. There are all sorts of claims circulating in the press. In the media today we heard that the 'senator for half measures' has prevented half of the potential double dissolutions but not the other half.
             </p>
             <p>
              No wonder his colleagues are still backgrounding the media and raising concerns about their long-term future. If Senator Di Natale had gone full measure, he would have made sure that the requirements of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Electoral Commission
              </a>
              —who were before us in the hearing earlier this week and have a full three months after this legislation is proclaimed by the Governor-General—were being met. But, no. Again the 'senator for half-measures' has provided far less than the full three months. You ask: where does that leave other senators? That leaves other senators—
