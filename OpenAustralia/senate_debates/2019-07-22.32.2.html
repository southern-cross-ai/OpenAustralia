         Social Services
        </a>
        , Senator Ruston. Last week in an interview with 3AW's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Mitchell" rel="nofollow">
         Neil Mitchell
        </a>
        , the minister described the age pension as 'generous'.

       <p>
        An honourable senator: What!
       </p>
       <p>
        Yes, that's what she described it as. Can the minister explain why pensioners doing it tough should accept her view that the payment is generous?

         I thank the senator for his question and for the opportunity to clarify this particular statement. I understand that many older Australians, particularly our age pensioners, are impacted significantly by cost-of-living pressures. But I would like to say that, with the comments that were reported in the paper last week, I certainly did not intend to say or to infer that older Australians who rely on the age pension are doing it easy. I am concerned that any offence may have been taken by or caused to our older Australians. As I said, I know older Australians are doing it tough and that's why one of the first things I did, on becoming the Minister for Families and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Social Services
         </a>
         , was to seek advice from my department in relation to deeming rates, which was the subject of the interview to which Senator Farrell is referring. In doing this, we managed to provide assistance to nearly a million older Australians and other recipients of allowances by reducing the deeming rates from the lower threshold by 75 basis points, or 0.75 per cent, and for the upper deeming rate by 25 basis points, or 0.25 per cent. This way we will see older Australians, about 360,000 older Australians, actually end up with more money in their pockets in their fortnightly payments.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other thing, too, is that the track record of this government since it came into government is a very strong track record of supporting older Australians. We have increased the pension for singles by $117.80 a fortnight and by $177.40 per fortnight for couples. You can be assured that this government will make a priority of looking after our older Australians.

           The Treasurer refused to endorse Senator Ruston's description of the pension as generous. Instead, he said, 'I understand pensioners have challenging times; a number of pensioners do it really, really tough'. Has the Treasurer, or any other member of the government, raised concerns with the minister about her comments?

            I thank Senator Farrell for his follow-up question. I agree entirely with the comments that the Treasurer made in relation to older Australians, particularly our age pensioners doing it tough at the moment. Cost-of-living pressures, financial pressures on older Australians, particularly those on pensions—

                But Australia has a very comprehensive social welfare system. One part of that is the aged pension. The sustainability of our social security system is absolutely essential. But I do not move away from the comments—

                    . I will say it again: I accept the fact that older Australians, particularly, aged pensioners, are doing it tough. The Morrison government has quite clearly made it a priority to look after older Australians, and our track record stands for itself.

                       The track record of the Morrison government when it comes to prioritising older Australians is one of which we can be proud. Notwithstanding the fact that many older Australians are doing it tough with cost-of-living pressures, the track record of the Morrison government is in ensuring that twice yearly we don't just increase pensions by

I said in response to the first question from Senator Farrell that I certainly did not intend to infer that older Australians were doing it easy. And I am concerned about any offence that may have occurred or been taken by older Australians over comments that were made.
