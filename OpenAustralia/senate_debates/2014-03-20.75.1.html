        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash. I refer the minister to the Prime Minister's pre-election promise that, 'No cuts to health means no cuts to mental health.' Given that one in five Australians will at some point suffer from a mental illness, can the minister guarantee to the Senate that there will be no cuts to front-line services in mental health?

         I thank the senator for his question. I think there is no doubt that it is we on this side of the chamber who have the commitment to front-line services. Indeed, it is this government who have said that we are going to ensure that the commitment is to front-line services, that funding goes to where it is needed, and where it is needed most is those front-line services. Very clearly, mental health is a very important issue, particularly in rural and regional areas such as where I am from, as Senator Sterle would well know. This government will adhere to ensuring that the delivery of mental health services is done and that that delivery goes to front-line services. That is where the need is.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is interesting that we are getting questions in this area from those on the other side, because when we look at their record on health and when we look at the fact of the three supposed historic health agreements—

            I was very clearly answering the question in stating the fact that this government's focus is going to be ensuring the delivery of front-line services, which includes mental health. That means ensuring that those services are available right across the nation, particularly to those in rural and regional communities. So indeed I am answering the question,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
             Mr President
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            When we look at the health record of those opposite, it becomes a stark contrast as to which side of this chamber is properly going to deliver health services for the regions and indeed the nation as a whole.

             , I ask a supplementary question. I refer the minister to the review of mental health funding promised by the coalition during the election. Can the minister guarantee that Partners in Recovery, a service that provides families and carers with a way of ensuring care for individuals that can be tailored to individual needs, will be safe from your chopping block?

              As the senator would know, there is no chopping block, and I certainly disagree with the assertion that the senator has made. Senators would be well aware of the economic situation that the previous Labor government has left for this nation. The government is considering future directions for a range of programs, as those on the other side well know. Unlike the previous government's—

                       , I ask a further supplementary question. Minister, why won't the government release the Commission of Audit until after the Western Australian Senate election? What cuts to mental health are you hiding?

                        The matter of the timing of the release of the Commission of Audit was canvassed yesterday in this chamber, I believe, and the government is considering the report from the Commission of Audit. As those on the other side would know, the Henry tax review was considered 'for my eyes' by the previous Labor government, for a period of six months, as I understand it. So we will be ensuring the proper consideration of the Commission of Audit, and the proper processes will be followed in terms of releasing it.
