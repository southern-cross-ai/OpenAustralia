        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Senator, over the last four weeks, at least 147 detainees have been released into the Australian community, including paedophiles, murderers, rapists and a contract killer. The result is that, just over the last few days, we have now seen five detainees arrested by police, including a serial sex offender being charged with alleged indecent assault of a woman in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the ringleader of a child exploitation gang being arrested for allegedly contacting minors. Why is it that, because of your failures, Australians are less safe now under this Labor government?

         I thank the senator for her question. I again remind those opposite that the decision to release was a decision of the High Court imposed upon the government. As a consequence, the government has put in place a range of measures, including those which have now been passed by the parliament, which are clearly aimed at ensuring we do all we can to keep Australians safe. And I would think that Senator Cash would understand that the government is dealing with two High Court decisions which have struck down laws which were applicable under you. Certainly in relation to the citizenship cessation, in fact, Mr Dutton has presided over not one but two unconstitutional laws.
        </p>
        <p>
         The facts are, as much as Senator Cash wishes to interject repeatedly, Australians are not kept safer by laws which fail, and your laws failed. That is the reality. It is the case that the government has put in place four layers of protection. They include preventive detention, community safety supervision orders, electronic monitoring devices and curfews, and stringent visa conditions. We will continue to do all we can.

             is due to be released. Revelations in this chamber last night revealed that the Attorney-General failed to apply to the court for a continuing detention order. It appears the only possible outcomes are that Australia's most notorious terrorist will be released with conditions or that he will simply be released into the Australian community. Why is it that, because of your failures, Australians are less safe now under this Labor government?
