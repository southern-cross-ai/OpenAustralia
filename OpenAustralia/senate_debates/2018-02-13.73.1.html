         You are correct: this week we celebrate the 20th annual Science meets Parliament. There will be a gala dinner tonight, which I understand a number of us are going to. Over the last 20 years it has very much become a celebration of collaboration between researchers, industry and government. Science meets Parliament is a key opportunity for government to hear directly from scientists on the important work they are doing and also on the issues their industry is facing. I also thank Science and Technology Australia for their continued role in coordinating this event.
        </p>
        <p>
         Science is an essential element of our culture, our community and our economic prosperity. The government provided $10.1 billion last year for science and research, and this year we increased it to $10.3 billion. We have also delivered on the National Innovation and Science Agenda and have made a public commitment to science, as part of Science meets Parliament last year, through Australia's National Science Statement. We have also had a busy start to this year. Earlier this year I was in Townsville and, along with the Prime Minister, announced a further investment of $60 million to secure the future of the

         . This investment will provide resources to help our scientists, led by the

         , to tackle the events which have hit the Great Barrier Reef over recent years. And Assistant Minister Seselja has launched TAIPAN, an instrument purpose-built for the

            We have some absolutely outstanding superstars in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and the assistant minister and I have spent the past few days meeting with a number of them. Today I announced that the government will be expanding the Superstars of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
             STEM
            </a>
            program. The expansion will double, from 30 to 60, the number of women participating in the program and it will also extend it out for another four years.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Superstars" rel="nofollow">
             The Superstars
            </a>
            of STEM creates opportunities for Australia's leading women in science, technology, engineering and maths to become strong public role models for the next generation. I think we all agree that 'you can't be it if you can't see it'. What these superstars do is role model to our next generation that they won't just have a job in science; they will have a career and they can reach the greatest heights. This is a sensational program and I look forward to working with Science and Technology Australia—

               The Turnbull government has put in place the right policy settings across the board in relation to job creation. And they are now paying off, with our economy creating approximately 1,100 jobs per day—that's right, 1,100 jobs per day. Jobs growth in the last 12 months is almost five times stronger than in Labor's last year of government. Our science policies are a key part of that—from the National Innovation and Science Agenda, which helps small business and researchers get access to funding to expand and turn their ideas into a reality, to our announcement of the creation of the space agency. Our science announcements are creating exciting opportunities for Australian businesses to prosper and grow and ultimately create more jobs for Australians.
