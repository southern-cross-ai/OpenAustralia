        In respect of the government response to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report
        <i>
         Strengthening Australia's relationships in the Pacific
        </i>
        , I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the document.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm pleased to rise to speak on the government's response, and I thank the committee for its report and welcome the parliament's broader focus on Australia's engagement with the Pacific. I thank the government for its consideration of these recommendations in the interests of strengthening Australia's relationship with the Pacific. As the then chair of the committee, Senator Dave Sharma, noted in his foreword:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia's relationships with the nations of the Pacific are of enduring importance. They are underpinned by a long shared history, common values, strong ties between peoples, and a natural empathy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since day one of this government, strengthening Australia's relationship with our Pacific family has been one of the highest foreign policy priorities. After only four days in office, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Wong" rel="nofollow">
         Penny Wong
        </a>
        , stood at the heart of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands_Forum" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Islands Forum
        </a>
        in Suva, Fiji. Senator Wong had travelled to Fiji to make clear the government's commitment to the Pacific—that this government would be a government that listened, that this government would respect the wisdom, knowledge and experience of Pacific leaders and that this government would act in the best collective interests of the blue Pacific continent.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_September" rel="nofollow">
         In September
        </a>
        2018, the Pacific Islands Forum issued the Boe declaration. This foundational document reaffirmed Pacific leaders' collective view that climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific. Climate change is not an abstract threat to the Pacific; it is an existential one. I thank the committee for recognising the threat climate change poses to livelihoods, security and wellbeing. The committee recommended support for climate change mitigation and adaptation, which continues to be a high priority in Australia's immediate regional assistance program. The government has accepted this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is why the Albanese government made tackling climate change at home and in the Pacific a cornerstone of its approach to the Pacific. Within this decade, 82 per cent of Australia's electricity generation will be renewable. The government have committed over $40 billion to transform our economy and deliver our ambition to become a renewable energy superpower, including $18 billion in investment in low-emissions technologies under the government's Technology Investment Roadmap. It's a huge transition, but the government is getting on with the job.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the Pacific, the government have strengthened our commitment to providing much-needed climate finance and has pledged to spend $700 million over five years to strengthen climate change and disaster resilience in the Pacific. The government is set to exceed this commitment. The government has rejoined the Green Climate Fund with a $50 million contribution and pledged $100 million to the Pacific resilience fund, the first ever Pacific led, Pacific owned community resilience finance facility. And, at the 52nd meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum, the government announced a package of climate assistance to the region, including at least $350 million in climate resilience infrastructure, with at least $75 million in off-grid and community-scale renewable energy in remote and rural parts of the Pacific.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has committed, as part of the International Development Policy, to ensure that 50 per cent of all new bilateral and regional investments, valued at more than $3 million, will have a climate outcome by 2024-25, increasing to 80 per cent by 2028. The government's transformational approach to climate change has been warmly welcomed by the Pacific and is making a huge difference at home and in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee had the insight and vision to recognise the valuable contribution the Pacific diaspora plays in Australia, enriching our communities and strengthening our already strong people-to-people links with the Pacific. The committee recommended the government consider creating a dedicated Pacific component within Australia's permanent migration intake, similar to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        model. The government also recognise the importance of growing our Pacific diaspora and deepening our ties with the Pacific family by encouraging migration to Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is why the Australian government has introduced the Pacific engagement visa. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEV" rel="nofollow">
         PEV
        </a>
        , as it's called, has been designed to grow the Pacific and Timor-Leste diasporas in Australia and encourage greater cultural business and educational exchange. The PEV is a substantial expression of the special relationship Australia has with the Pacific, helping address the underrepresentation of these countries in Australia's permanent migration program. There are up to 3,000 visas, inclusive of partners and dependent children, which will be allocated annually. These are due to commence on 3 June, and the PEV will be a game changer for Australia's relationships with the Pacific.
       </p>
       <p>
        I welcome the bipartisan approach that the committee took in its inquiry on strengthening Australia's relationships in the Pacific. I appreciate the effort that went into providing thoughtful and considered recommendations that were agreed by the full membership of the committee for the government to consider, and I welcome the government's leadership in responding to the committee's call for greater action on climate change and an initiative to grow the Pacific diaspora in Australia. What I cannot understand is why the coalition continues to disrespect the Pacific, ignoring recommendations of its own committee members.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee recognises the folly of ignoring the threat of climate change, of ignoring the priority the Pacific places on tackling the single greatest threat to its livelihood, security and prosperity. Yet for nine long years the Liberals and Nationals disrespected our Pacific family. It was the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton, who made jokes about water lapping at the doors of Pacific countries. Some in the coalition still don't believe climate change is even real. The coalition continues to put forward policies which are detached from reality, seeking to build expensive nuclear reactors in backyards across the country instead of taking real action to embrace renewables and transform Australia's energy market.
       </p>
       <p>
        What's more, despite the support of coalition members on the committee, the coalition has continued to obstruct the government's efforts to build our Pacific diaspora. They know that, as competition in the region intensifies, Australia's natural advantage lies in our people and our community's access to labour markets and stronger cultural business connections. Yet they still refuse to listen to our Pacific family. While the PEV has been warmly welcomed by our Pacific partners, it is very disappointing to see those opposite refusing to support it. But it's really not surprising.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that those opposite dropped the ball when it came to the Pacific and failed to ensure that Australia remained a partner of choice. What beggars belief is that this visa system with the ballot was originally their idea.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal" rel="nofollow">
         The Liberal
        </a>
        -chaired committee recommended a dedicated Pacific migration intake modelled on the New Zealand ballot—and Senator Fawcett was on this committee at the time. They recommended a ballot in government, and now they're opposing it in opposition. That tells you all you need to know about the seriousness with which they treat our national interest. They continue to prioritise negativity and division over building a stronger Pacific family, and they're not even trying to be consistent in their relentless negativity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The opposition has ridiculed the idea of a ballot despite the fact that our closest friends in New Zealand and the United States have been using a ballot system for decades. It's argued that our model will lead to a brain drain, despite a ballot being the very best way to ensure equitable access regardless of skill level, directly mitigating this concern. Their approach is not about facts at all. It's about fear. It's not about Australia's national interest. It's about the personal political interests of Mr Peter Dutton and Mr Dan Tehan. If those opposite were serious about ensuring Australia remains the partner of choice in a more contested region, they would listen to members on the committee and get on board with delivering these recommendations.
       </p>
       <p>
        In delivering the government's response to the committee report today, the government has yet again demonstrated its commitment to the Pacific. This is a government that listens. This is a government that values the wisdom, knowledge and experience of our Pacific leaders. And this is a government that will act in the best collective interests of the blue Pacific continent. I recommend the coalition get on board with the vision and the leadership of its members on this committee and start working in the best interests of Australia and of the Pacific.
