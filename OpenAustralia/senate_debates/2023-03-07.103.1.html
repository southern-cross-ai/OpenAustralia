        My question is for the Minister representing the Minister for Housing, Senator Farrell. Minister, cost-of-living pressures are hitting Tasmanians hard. The current average rent is 550 bucks a week, and it is getting worse. The costs of groceries, fuel, energy and everyday living expenses are skyrocketing for Tasmanians. Life is basically getting harder. The waiting list for public housing sits at around 4,500, and that's on a good day. This list is growing and growing and growing. My question is in relation to the Housing Australia Future Fund. When will the detail of the investment mandate finally be released?

         I thank Senator Lambie for her question. As I indicated in my previous answer to Senator Pocock on the issue of housing and homelessness, the government obviously recognises that this is a significant issue. The former government, in almost 10 years, did nothing in this space, and so, of course, we have to make up for 10 years of neglect. We're doing that, Senator Lambie, and, as we speak, there are discussions underway in respect of the fund that you just mentioned. I'm sure, if you would like, I can organise for you to have some discussions with the minister responsible in this area about these issues to get some update on the latest state of play with these issues. But I give you this assurance, Senator Lambie: this government understands that there are problems here, understands that there have been years and years of neglect and understands that we now have the obligation of dealing with this issue, correcting the problems of the past and making sure that we deal with this issue into the future.

           , I was just wondering whether I could have the detail of when the investment mandate will be released. It's a simple detail: what date, what month—simple. I would have thought that was simple.

            Thank you, Senator Lambie. There was also quite a long introduction to that question. I do believe the minister's being relevant, but I'll continue to listen and, if he's not, I'll draw him to the question.

             I thought I had directly answered your question, Senator Lambie, but I'll restate it. The investment mandate is currently being considered. Of course, the legislation hasn't yet passed the parliament, and we understand, of course, that the coalition is opposing it.

               Minister, Australia currently has a skills shortage across every sector. It is very hard to find tradies to do any work at the best of times on any home. We know a trade takes three or four years to complete and that

               s in Tasmania are still training with Cold War equipment. Can the minister explain how the government will achieve 30,000 homes with no qualified tradies and with Cold War equipment in our TAFEs?

                I thank Senator Lambie for her question. The housing industry is not the only area that has labour shortages, as I'm sure you know. Labour shortages are a relic of the inaction of the previous government, particularly in the pandemic era. They sent home lots and lots of people who might have been here to help build some of these houses. One of the significant policies that we took to the last election—of course, Senator Lambie, as you would know—was the fee-free

                courses. Now, I appreciate that that doesn't come in overnight and it doesn't solve the problem overnight—

                  , for that correction. My last supplementary question is this: Minister, as my colleague Senator Tyrrell has brought to your attention, Tasmania has an entitlement of 1,200 homes, so why is it that we have the housing minister who represents Tasmania and we're only getting 600 of that? Will the government today, right now, guarantee me that Tasmania will get what it is entitled to and get their 1,200 homes over the next five years?

                   I thank Senator Lambie for her supplementary question. I have the greatest of faith in Minister Collins. I was recently down in Tasmania with her, going to a range of places, and I'm sure that there's no better person in this government that understands the problems of housing and housing shortages and all of the issues associated with it than Senator Collins. I think you should—

                   An honourable senator: She's not a senator.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Sorry, Minister Collins. I'd upgraded her to Senate status!

                     A point of order on relevance: with all due respect, I just want to know whether we're going to get the 1,200 homes that we actually should be getting, and not the 600, and whether that promise is going to be made right now. I don't want the waffle. Tasmanians just want to know if we're going to get what we're due for—1,200—or are you going to take half of them off us?
