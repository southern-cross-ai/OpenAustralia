        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. I refer to new evidence in relation to the unauthorised leaking of a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Federal Police
        </a>
        raid on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers'_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Workers' Union
        </a>
        offices that discloses Minister Cash's then chief of staff was the source of the leak. Minister Cash's then senior media adviser, when deciding to leak advance notice of police raids, was motivated by an intention to damage the Leader of the Opposition's reputation. The office of the then Minister for Justice was advised prior to the raids commencing by Minister Cash's office, and Minister Cash's then senior media adviser worked with the then Minister for Justice's media adviser to leak the raids to the media. In light of these revelations, has Mr Morrison sought and received assurances from Minister Cash that her statements to the Senate and all of her public statements have provided a full and frank account of her involvement in this affair?

        <p>
         Firstly, the Prime Minister has full confidence in Minister Cash. Minister Cash has been entirely forthright in her public statements in relation to those matters, and, indeed, as she has indicated on a number of occasions, has provided answers to questions based on her personal state of knowledge at that time. Yesterday, in response to questions, Minister Cash again indicated that she stood by those statements. Of course, we also know that this is a matter that is currently before the courts, and, as such, it wouldn't be appropriate for the government to comment any further.

              The point of order is on direct relevance. I assume my colleague Senator Cormann was getting to it. The question was whether or not the actions were appropriate and within the law. Is that the Prime Minister's belief?

                     On the point of order, the minister had been speaking for 15 seconds. I will listen carefully, but it sounded to me like he was coming directly to the points you raised. I can't instruct him how to answer the question, as long he's relevant to part of it.

The third point I would make is that, obviously, all of these matters that Senator Wong has canvassed are currently the subject of court hearings, which will test all of the evidence and which will make judgments at the end of that process. It is entirely—

                              The answer to that question is yes. The answer to that question is an absolute Y-E-S yes. There is nothing in the attempted smear and innuendo that Senator Wong and other senators have tried to throw around that in any way contradicts the statements that Senator Cash has made in Senate estimates or in the Senate chamber in relation to these matters. Others might from time to time be making other claims which are currently being tested through a court process.

                              should be allowing the court process to take its course in the ordinary course of events. There will be a resolution at the end of that process. It wouldn't be appropriate for the government to provide a running commentary in relation to these proceedings.
