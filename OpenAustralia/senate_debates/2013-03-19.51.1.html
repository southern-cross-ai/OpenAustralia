          My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. Can the minister update the Senate on the Gillard government's approach to supporting the not-for-profit sector? In particular can the minister outline any steps taken by the government to safeguard the right of the not-for-profit sector to advocate in the interests of the community?

           I thank the senator for her question. Of course she hails from the state of Queensland in which we see a conservative government demonstrating what they really think about free speech as they muzzle the not-for-profit sector and the people who do good work in our community because they do not want people to complain about the cuts they are making. This is from the party that prides itself on being the party of free speech.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have been waiting to hear from the Queenslanders on that side because they are generally very quiet—Senator Brandis and Senator Macdonald. I have been waiting for them to actually stand up and argue for free speech for Queenslanders. I have been waiting for that, but I suspect we are still waiting. On this side of the chamber we understand the importance of the not-for-profit sector and we understand its value. We appreciate the important work community organisations do. We believe it is vital for these organisations to be independent and free to advocate for change. That is why this government is safeguarding the right of the not-for-profit sector to advocate in the interests of the community.
          </p>
          <p>
           As a government, we have made clear that we will ban the use of gag clauses in government contracts with the not-for-profit sector, because we actually believe in freedom of speech. When we came to government in 2008, we made clear the position of the Labor government. In 2008 we introduced this as Commonwealth policy, and now we are taking this one step further and we will legislate for it. We will legislate to ban the gag clauses that are a part of the conservative modus operandi.

            , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister outline any precedents in Commonwealth contracts with the not-for-profit sector that indicate the real need for a legislative approach to guarantee this right to advocate?

             I have been asked about precedents. The precedents should be known to those opposite. I suspect a couple of them might have been staffers, because it was the former Howard government and the former Treasurer,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Costello" rel="nofollow">
              Peter Costello
             </a>
             , who introduced gag clauses into Commonwealth contracts when those opposite were in power. They are very silent over there about the principle of freedom of speech. Who removed that? This Labor government removed that policy. Where else is it in place? Queensland.

               I will take that interjection. We removed it in 2008. We are now introducing an additional protection, which is to put it in legislation. But, of course, what we see in Queensland is a double whammy: a coalition government cutting services and then gagging the people who would speak out against it.

                 The government understands that every dollar spent on administration by a community organisation is a dollar not spent on delivering important services, which is why I have recently announced a number of measures to improve our interaction with the sector and to reduce unnecessary red tape for community organisations. We have also revised Commonwealth grant guidelines to lessen the burden of red tape on this sector.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This cooperative approach stands in stark contrast to what we have seen from coalition governments in the federal sphere and what we continue to see from the Newman government. These people trumpet freedom of speech. These people opposite have been lecturing us about freedom of speech, but when it comes to protecting the charities and not-for-profit organisations who deliver to the neediest in the Australian community and the rights of those people to speak out, we hear nothing.
