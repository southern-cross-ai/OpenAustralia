       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Interim Report was published on 3 May 2016 and the Final Report was published on 26 October 2017.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since the release of the committee's reports there have been a number of road safety initiatives progressed by the Australian Government with the state and territory governments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In May 2018, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
         Council of Australian Governments
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        ) Transport and Infrastructure Council (Council) endorsed the National Road Safety Action Plan for the final three years of the National Road Safety Strategy 2011-2020 (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRSS" rel="nofollow">
         NRSS
        </a>
        ), which includes a number of actions that focus on targeting infrastructure funding towards initiatives to reduce trauma on our roads.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 12 September 2018, the Australian Government received the report of the independent Inquiry into the NRSS, which provided advice on how governments can work together to take stronger and more effective actions to reduce road trauma.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inquiry" rel="nofollow">
         The Inquiry
        </a>
        report made recommendations covering a wide range of areas such as road safety leadership, resourcing, performance monitoring and innovative technology. The report included recommendations for action by the Australian Government as well as a number of recommendations requiring coordinated efforts across all levels of government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In November 2018 the Council agreed to develop a response to those recommendations for which all governments are responsible. The final response and implementation arrangements for the Inquiry recommendations will be published by December 2019.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has undertaken a Review of National Road Safety Governance, as recommended in the NRSS Inquiry report, in consultation with the states and territories. The review was endorsed by the Council in August 2019 and published on the NRSS website: www.roadsafety.gov.au. An Office of Road Safety has been established in the

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government commit $150,000 for three years from 2016-17 to fund the continued operation of the Australian Trauma Registry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has committed $300,000 to fund the Australian Trauma Registry until 2021-22.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Registry" rel="nofollow">
         The Registry
        </a>
        is an important source of data on people who are severely injured as the result of road crashes, among other causes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transport_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         National Transport Commission
        </a>
        amend the model
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Road_Rules" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Road Rules
        </a>
        to mandate a safe passing distance for drivers overtaking cyclists of one metre where the speed limit is 60 kilometres per hour or lower and 1.5 metres where the speed limit is higher.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports this recommendation in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The adoption and application of road rules is a matter for the state and territory governments. Safe passing distance rules have been adopted in all states and territories, with the exception of Victoria.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The National Transport Commission (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTC" rel="nofollow">
         NTC
        </a>
        ) is responsible for reviewing and updating the Australian Road Rules (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARR" rel="nofollow">
         ARR
        </a>
        ) as part of its maintenance of legislative reforms. The NTC convenes an ARR Maintenance Group (ARRMG) which consists of representatives of the state and territory police and road traffic authorities. This group provides advice and makes recommendations to the NTC on changes to the ARR.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        participates in the ARRMG through the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications. The ARRMG has considered the proposal to amend the ARR to prescribe a minimum passing distance when overtaking bicycles. However, no consensus proposal has been agreed by the states and territories at this stage.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the National Transport Commission re-establish a national consultative committee on motorcycle safety.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation, but supports effective communication with motorcycle groups and other road user groups.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Current stakeholder consultation arrangements are flexible and efficient and allow the Government to engage with motorcycling groups and other stakeholders on specific issues as they arise.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For example:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the National Transport Commission develop and implement a national strategy for motorcycle safety.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The NRSS is an overarching framework which complements the strategic road safety plans of state, territory and local governments and the work of other stakeholders. Under the Safe System approach, separate national road safety strategies for different road user groups are not necessary, as the interventions are expected to benefit multiple groups.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Action Plan contains a number of specific actions, as well as some broader ones, that will benefit this group of vulnerable road users. Specific actions include introduction of a rating scheme for motorcycle protective clothing and strengthening of Graduated Licensing Systems (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLS" rel="nofollow">
         GLS
        </a>
        ) for motorcycle riders. Benefits to riders are also expected through broader actions such as targeting infrastructure funding and speed reduction measures to reduce trauma on regional roads and at urban intersections; the development of network-wide safety plans; and the implementation of safer speeds and improved enforcement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In developing the next national road safety strategy and action plan through the Council, governments will consider what action is required to further support safer outcomes for motorcyclists.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government commit increased financial support to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasian_New_Car_Assessment_Program" rel="nofollow">
         Australasian New Car Assessment Program
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANCAP" rel="nofollow">
         ANCAP
        </a>
        ) over the forward estimates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has committed an additional $6.64 million in funding for the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) from 2018-19, bringing the total to $8.84 million from 2016-17 to 2022-23.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 6
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with state and territory governments to ensure that display of Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) safety ratings becomes mandatory at point of sale.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ANCAP is a consumer information program that is not subject to stringent regulatory processes. This flexibility allows ANCAP to respond quickly to market innovation and to progressively raise the requirements for its rating levels. Mandatory ANCAP safety ratings at point of sale would require all makes and models of vehicles to be subjected to ANCAP rating tests, imposing a substantial cost to business and creating a unique Australian requirement that would be out of step with the global market. It may also effectively change ANCAP into a regulated scheme that would then be subject to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS" rel="nofollow">
         RIS
        </a>
        processes, undermining the complementary benefit of a flexible scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 7
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government continues to fund
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University_Accident_Research_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Monash University Accident Research Centre
        </a>
        to produce the Used Car Safety Ratings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has been providing funding to the Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC) to produce the Used Car Safety Ratings (UCSR) annually for over 20 years. The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications is discussing funding for the UCSR from 2019-20 onwards with ANCAP, which is taking overall responsibility for the UCSR and will engage MUARC to continue this work.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 8
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Design_Rules" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Design Rules
        </a>
        be immediately amended to require all new light vehicles sold in Australia from 1 June 2017 be fitted with automatic emergency braking technology.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports this recommendation in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports increased uptake of Autonomous Emergency Braking (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEB" rel="nofollow">
         AEB
        </a>
        ) systems, including through its support of ANCAP.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From" rel="nofollow">
         From
        </a>
        2018, ANCAP aligned protocols for its safety ratings to those used by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_NCAP" rel="nofollow">
         Euro NCAP
        </a>
        , with AEB becoming a mandatory requirement towards achieving a five star rating. ANCAP has advised that 54 per cent of new cars and light commercial vehicles sold in Australia now offer AEB as a standard feature. AEB is available on a range of makes, models and vehicle types including on lower cost models such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Picanto" rel="nofollow">
         Kia Picanto
        </a>
        ($17,290) and Mazda 2 ($18,540).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        AEB for both light and heavy vehicles is a priority in the Action Plan for 2018-2020, and a Regulation Impact Statement (RIS) for heavy vehicle AEB was released for consultation in August 2019. The Department is preparing a RIS for AEB for light vehicles, in parallel with the finalisation of an international standard through the United Nations World Forum for the Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations. The Department expects to release the RIS in early 2020.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 9
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that Commonwealth Government increase funding to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spot_Program" rel="nofollow">
         Black Spot Program
        </a>
        me and increase the percentage allocated to regional and remote areas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has already committed $100 billion for infrastructure investment over the next ten years. This includes an additional $2.2 billion from 2019-20 for the Local and State Government Road Safety Package, which will provide:

        The Black Spot Program Notes on Administration (NoA) state that funds will be allocated on a 50:50 basis between rural and urban areas, where nominations allow.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        is able to approve a greater proportion of funding for regional and remote areas should such funding levels be recommended by the Black Spot Consultative Panels established in each jurisdiction to review project proposals.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 10
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the definition of ' black spot ' be revised to account for the dispersed nature of accidents in regional and remote areas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government notes this recommendation and considers there is sufficient flexibility in the Program to fund these types of projects.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government notes that the Black Spot Program is already able to fund projects that treat lengths of road and that up to 30 per cent of program funds can be used for projects where there is an assessed risk that serious crashes are likely.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Eligible network-wide projects in a specific area are also able to be nominated. For example, several projects for bicycle safety treatments at various roundabouts in Cairns have been funded under the Program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 11
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that Commonwealth, state and territory governments work with police agencies to increase the number of point-to-point speed cameras in regional and remote areas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports this recommendation in principle, noting that responsibility for speed cameras lies with the states and territories.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In Australia's federal system, the state and territory governments have direct responsibility for traffic regulation and enforcement, including decisions about the use of speed cameras. The Action Plan includes specific action for state and territory governments to increase the deployment of point-to-point speed cameras on Australian roads (action 7). Most jurisdictions have now implemented at least some point-to-point speed cameras or have plans to do so.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 12
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Australian Curriculum includes road awareness training for both primary and secondary school students.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>

        , the nationally agreed Foundation to Year 10 Australian Curriculum (the Curriculum), sets the expectations for what all Australian students should be taught, regardless of where they live or their background.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the Australian Government works collaboratively with all states and territories, individual education authorities and schools are responsible for and have the flexibility to adapt the curriculum to ensure education programs can be tailored to meet the needs of their teachers and students. This provides flexibility to cater for emerging issues and local context. Further information about the Curriculum is available at www.australiancurriculum.edu.au.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As schools and school systems throughout the country implement the Australian Curriculum in ways that best meet the needs of their students, the flexible and comprehensive nature of the Curriculum provides strong support for initiatives such as road safety. This flexibility enables state and territory education authorities and individual schools to identify and make decisions on training and programs used such as road safety, to support implementation of the Australian Curriculum.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Curriculum includes content on safety that it is expected all students at appropriate intervals across the continuum of learning from Foundation to Year 10 will learn about. Topics include safety at school, safe practices at home, and in road or transport environments. Schools and teachers teach young learners to navigate a range of health-related sources, services and organisations, particularly in relation to becoming actively engaged in their own and others' wellbeing, using health, safety and physical activity resources for the benefit of themselves and their communities. A range of resources including for road safety have been developed by ACARA to support implementation of the Australian Curriculum.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Curriculum addresses and balances a wide range of competing demands for content. The Australian Curriculum was reviewed and enhancements endorsed by all Education ministers in September 2015. ACARA is scheduled to provide advice to education ministers on the potential scope for refinements of the Australian Curriculum in 2019-20. The endorsement of all education ministers is required before changes to the Australian Curriculum can be made.

The P Drivers project was a large-scale trial of a post-licence driver education program for young P-plate drivers aged 18 to 22 years. The project—the first of its kind undertaken anywhere in the world—aimed to implement and assess a new approach to driver education seeking to raise awareness about risk factors, improve decision making and provide novice drivers with insight into their skill limitations, through experiential learning. The aim of the trial was to test whether the program reduced the number of crashes and fatalities involving young, inexperienced drivers and promoted safe driving behaviour. A report detailing the results of the P Drivers Project is expected in late 2019 or early 2020.

Most jurisdictions have given consideration to the inclusion of first aid training requirements at some stage but none has done so to date. The prevailing view is that they did not favour placing an additional requirement on learners, which would increase the cost of licensing and not directly relate to learning to drive safely. They also noted the lack of evidence that basic first aid training would reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries.

        with a modern and flexible regulatory framework that will improve community safety, reduce compliance costs to business and expand consumer choice.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new legislation will continue to ensure that road vehicles and road vehicle components provided in Australia meet national minimum safety standards, as well as anti-theft and environmental standards, so consumers are provided with a choice of road vehicles that meet the safety and environmental expectations of the community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The legislation achieves this by regulating the first provision of road vehicles in Australia ­including allowing limited second-hand vehicle importation that meets objective criteria. It is also well prepared for future developments in international road vehicle standards to address technologies expected to improve road safety, such as autonomous vehicle technology and intelligent transport systems.
       </p>

       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Australian Government explore methods to introduce Australian Design Rules (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADR" rel="nofollow">
         ADR
        </a>

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications is exploring options to streamline the process for legislative and regulatory changes to vehicle safety standards to improve the uptake of new safety technology in the Australian new vehicle fleet, and will endeavour to align Australian regulations with the proposed European regulatory package to commence within a similar timeframe.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government initially encourages through consumer programs, then mandates if justified, the latest developments in vehicle safety technology. It considers the ADRs to be in broad alignment with those of other developed nations, although there are some issues that can add time to the process of developing vehicle standards. These include Australia having a mixed vehicle fleet with vehicles originating from a range of markets, and the need to ensure that any standards adopted are suited to the operating conditions for vehicles in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will continue to harmonise the ADRs with international regulations and remove unique local content where possible. To facilitate this, there is an ongoing program to adopt individual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        regulations under the UN 1958 Agreement, particularly those related to international whole vehicle type approval. This ensures that regulatory barriers to the latest technology are reduced and costs are minimised for the consumer. This program allows the Australian Government to focus on mandating the most critical technologies.

        Recommendation 7
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Australian Government convene a series of industry-led roundtables to make recommendations to government to establish an independent industry body which has the power to formulate, implement and enforce supply chain standards and accountability as well as sustainable, safe rates for the transport industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 18 April 2016, the Government introduced legislation into the Parliament repealing the
        <i>
         Road Safety Remuneration Act 2012.
        </i>
        The legislation successfully passed the Parliament and the Road Safety Remuneration System, including the Tribunal and the orders it made, ceased to operate on 21 April 2016. The Government has committed to never re-establish the Tribunal or a similar body that sets mandatory rates of pay for owner drivers and small transport businesses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government's decision to abolish the System was informed by two independent reviews and extensive feedback received from industry participants. The reviews, conducted by Jaguar Consulting and Pricewaterhouse Coopers, recommended that the Tribunal be dismantled as they could establish no conclusive link between safety outcomes and rates of remuneration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following the release of the review reports, the then
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Employment" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Employment
        </a>
        consulted more than 150 industry participants from across Australia. The overwhelming feedback from these consultations was to abolish the Tribunal. Industry participants were of the firm view that the Tribunal did not improve safety and instead caused financial damage to owner drivers and uncertainty for an entire industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This was supported by the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman's inquiry into the effect of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal's Payments Order on Australian small businesses. The Ombudsman concluded that safety in the road transport industry should not be addressed by setting mandatory rates of pay.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is committed to investing in safety initiatives that have a direct impact on improving safety outcomes for the transport industry. The Government is providing $22 million over four years to the NHVR to progress a package of practical initiatives that will improve safety in the heavy vehicle industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Funding of initiatives in 2016-17 and 2017-18 included: chain of responsibility education for industry, improved heavy vehicle monitoring capability, the development of a Master Industry Code of Practice, establishing the Heavy Vehicle Confidential Reporting Line, piloting new livestock transfer infrastructure, and developing safer freight networks in areas identified as higher risk.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2018-19, funding is supporting the expansion of the National Safety Camera Network, fatigue management courses and safety education and awareness raising campaigns, such as the #GetTruckWise campaign.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As noted by the committee, the NHVR has the power to formulate, implement and enforce supply chain standards and accountability. The Australian Government has worked proactively with the states and territories on amendments to the HVNL to require all responsible parties in a goods or services supply chain to take reasonable steps to prevent breaches of road transport laws, including those relating to fatigue and transport operations. These changes took effect in mid-2018. The establishment of a new industry body with powers in relation to supply chains standards would therefore be unnecessary and duplicative.

         I move:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         That the Senate take note of the document.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a report that was done following a very lengthy—I think it was about three years—inquiry into road safety. I was joined in that committee work by Senator Gallacher. I think Senator Brockman was on the committee at the time. Senator Back was on it. The report was called
         <i>
          Aspects of road safety in Australia
         </i>
         , and it was done in the previous parliament. I want to thank former senator Barry O'Sullivan and the committee for the hard work that was put in. It was a very bipartisan inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
         It started off because we had lost the Australian vehicle-manufacturing industry and we thought it could be a good time to start looking at safety standards in vehicles and all sorts of other things. What came out of it was an interesting report. I had seen on the social media—in 2014, I think it was—that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Reason" rel="nofollow">
          Chris Reason
         </a>
         from

         </a>
         had tweeted about a Scotts Transport B-double, which is two trailers joined together, a bit shorter than a road train, that was on the M5. It was a two-up team from Brisbane running to Sydney, and the drivers had gone down the M5 and couldn't get into the airport tunnel at Sydney. One driver had refused to get out of the bunk, and the other driver just stood there like a stunned mullet. When he was asked by the reporter, while traffic was banking up behind him at peak hour, whether he shouldn't at least back the B-double up so he could get out of the way and let traffic flow, his response was that he didn't know how to. Anyway, it went on and on and on. So we realised that there was a serious problem within the road transport industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         The report has finally come back. I will always give credit where credit is due, and I'll go through each of the recommendations when I have the opportunity at a later date, and I will congratulate the government when they have finally done something, if they have done something, but I will be extraordinarily critical if they have not done anything or they have just ignored the report, because road safety should not be political; it should be in the front of the mind of everyone in this building, in this chamber and the other chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is something I want to just touch on. There was one recommendation that is timely to talk about. I will read the recommendation. I'm not cherrypicking; because of the contribution I made in this chamber last week, it is topical right now. The committee—not Labor but the committee, all of us—recommended that 'Australian Skills Quality Authority conduct an audit of all heavy vehicle driver training facilities (registered training organisations) in Australia', because we found that there was the odd crook, corrupt
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTO" rel="nofollow">
          RTO
         </a>
         . And we found that there was a crook, corrupt RTO up there in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
          Coffs Harbour
         </a>
         —whose name escapes me at the moment because it was that many years ago—who had employed their own trainer who recruited fellow countrymen from where he came from, to exploit them. He took money from them and then he trained them and then he had a deal with the Queensland government—and the Queensland government were not implicated in this; they were as clean as anything—because they had a mutual recognition agreement, where heavy vehicle licences were handed out like confetti at a wedding. To cut a very long story short, there were about 120 of them, and 80 of them gave their licences back when the Queensland government wanted to send out show-causes as to why they should keep them. There were a handful—I think 20 or 30—who actually kept their licences because they could drive, but the rest had all been given their licence for a small fee to the corrupt, crook RTO.
        </p>
        <p>
         Anyway, what has come back is that the Australian government has noted this recommendation. They're not going to do anything about it; they've noted it. This is what the government said. I'm talking about skills here—having our heavy vehicle drivers trained properly. The government says it is committed to reducing regulatory burden and red tape. Since when has training heavy vehicle drivers to be safe on our highways—not only so they don't kill themselves but so that they don't kill some other poor devil coming the other way or driving alongside them—been red tape and a regulatory burden?
        </p>
        <p>
         It really irks me. I have to talk about this recommendation because of the contribution I made in here last week. I have the court transcript of that shocking situation in Melbourne back in 2017. Truck driver Samandeep Singh couldn't stop the overloaded truck. The brakes were faulty. He knew they were faulty. It even says so in the transcript. I'm not making this up. It was shoddy workmanship from an unqualified mechanic. He was working for a crook—a ratbag, rotten-to-the-core trucking company by the name of Ermes Transport, who were contracting to Civic Transport Services, who are all over Australia. Their website says they do everything from cars, couriers and trucks through to B-double operators. They've got them all. He was working for this company, and these crooks were working for Civic Transport Services. This poor truck driver—let alone First Constable De Leo, who was killed on her way to work, sitting on her motorbike, and the torment to both those families. The man has covered himself in tattoos. He's a walking monument to the police officer. He's tattooed himself with her police number. He's tattooed himself with the date that he unfortunately killed her because of the faulty truck, which had no brakes and was loaded incorrectly.
        </p>
        <p>
         I could go on all day about this. The nation needs to know about this. It says in the court transcript here that the judge said to Mr Singh: 'Very briefly stated, you obtained your heavy rigid vehicle licence in August of 2016 after a one-day course.' I drove road trains from Perth to Darwin for 12 years, but I wouldn't dare to think that I know everything. A one-day course! That was with the crook Ermes Transport. Then he went to Civic Transport Services, which employed the crooks at Ermes Transport, and did a course there. A course on what? What the hell? Who is training? What are their qualifications?
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, no-one has prosecuted the crooks at Ermes Transport or gone further up the chain. What I did find out is that there were 11 trucks that this crook Ermes Transport owned. I don't know if they were all working for Civic—they probably were. And that's before I even start on Civic Transport Services. I'm coming back for them as well. Make no mistake about that. The police couldn't prosecute, but there were 11 trucks that all got an improvement notice or some notice to fix the truck because it wasn't working. How many more people have to be killed on our roads?
        </p>
        <p>
         Our truckies are the salt of the earth. We should be bowing to our truck drivers and thanking them for the job that they do. They are essential workers. They're at the front line. In my heart this has been known for three generations. I know what we do as truck drivers. We go about our business quietly. We don't want flowers thrown at our feet. We don't want people saying, 'Oh, we love our truck drivers.' We just want to be paid properly and respected, and we want to get home to our families safely. But every time something goes wrong on the road, it's the truckies' fault.
        </p>
        <p>
         I come back to the government: is there nobody on that side of the chamber who will listen when I sit up here and say, 'Stop! No more!'? We can't have deaths on our roads that can be avoided. We can't run protection rackets for the ratbags out there that are doing the wrong thing. What do we say to the victims' families—'Oh, that's just another statistic. It's not a work death. It's just another road statistic. It's part of doing business in this nation'? For the life of me, what do I have to do to get the attention of that side of the chamber? Is there not someone in a minister's office who is listening and thinking, 'For Christ's sake, he actually makes sense'?

           Why aren't we jumping on this? Minister Cash and Minister McCormack, we talk about training. Is no-one going to do something to start saving lives? Accidents happen, but this is trucks being overloaded and not loaded properly. This is truck drivers crookedly or corruptly getting their licences. This is scumbag transport companies doing their own training and stealing work and food off the decent men and women in the transport industry who do the right thing. Where is the Australian Trucking Association? You say you're the voice of the transport industry. You are imposters! If you were the voice of the transport industry, you would be standing alongside me and you would be demanding that something is done in this nation to stop this rot.
          </p>
          <p>
           Please, someone! I'm starting to think I'm losing the plot. What do we tell the families who have lost loved ones, because someone's got a licence, after one day, and doesn't know what the hell they are doing and then jumps into a bucket of nuts and bolts that has been glued together by an unqualified mechanic? And the employer is still out there doing his thing! Nothing is wrong with him! A young man's life was destroyed—he is in jail for four years—

            I also want to speak on the government's response to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References

            inquiry into road safety, which I was part of. It seems like it was quite a long time ago. Given that it's taken that long to get a response from the government, it makes me realise just how seriously—not!—they take the issue of road safety. And here it is, at 4 o'clock on the last sitting day of this session, and suddenly it's just landed. I haven't yet even had a chance to look at the government's response, but I'm pretty sure—and certainly from what Senator Sterle said about some key recommendations from the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRAT" rel="nofollow">
             RRAT
            </a>
            inquiry having just been 'noted'—that there's nothing to change the business-as-usual approach to road safety, which has been the ongoing situation and which just has to stop.
           </p>
           <p>
            We had the RRAT inquiry and the government then had an inquiry into road safety, with some eminent road safety experts chairing that inquiry, that put some really powerful recommendations to government. They said that there needs to be a change in the whole approach, that it's just not good enough to keep on doing the same measures over and over again to try to minimise accidents, to try to improve road safety; there's got to be a complete holistic look at how we eliminate the issues of lack of safe conditions on our roads so that we do not continue to have hundreds of people die on our roads, and thousands, tens of thousands, of people who are severely injured and suffer lifetime consequences from road accidents.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the recommendations from the government inquiry was that we should be spending $3 billion a year on road safety, if we are going to be serious about it. That's the context in which to put the government's announcement earlier this week—yes, it's great that there's a commitment to spend half a billion on road safety a year, but it's not going to cut it. It's just not going to be enough to really change the situation so we don't continue to have the deaths. As Senator Sterle said, these aren't just statistics. Every one of the people who dies on our roads, or is severely injured, is a human being. It is the massive consequences and the massive costs for them, their families and their friends, ongoing for their whole lives. This is something that we Australians, and this government—all of us here—need to seriously look at and say that there needs to be a change. It's not good enough just to say, 'Alright, it's going to take us a year to respond to the road safety inquiry. Alright, we're just going to have another inquiry.' We had the government's inquiry last year, and now we've got the joint standing committee having yet another inquiry. To me, you have inquiry after inquiry after inquiry when you have no commitment to actually do something serious.
           </p>
           <p>
            Certainly, I commit the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greens" rel="nofollow">
             Greens
            </a>
            to working collaboratively with the government and the opposition to work out how we can get the serious action that is required to eliminate deaths on our roads, to eliminate those accidents. Finally, I particularly want to call out the most vulnerable road users, who are not being considered, who are just being swept away. They are pedestrians and cyclists, who are being killed on our roads at a rate much higher than the proportion of road users that they are. That's because the conditions are just not safe for them. In the case of cycling, we do not have cycling infrastructure that enables people to have the freedom to ride safely. Particularly in these times, we know of the benefits from encouraging more people to ride. In the current context, it means that we won't have the huge crushes on public transport, which are of concern under the COVID pandemic. We've got people that want to ride. We've had almost three times the number of people cycling over the last three months than previously. And how do we get those people to keep riding? They've got to feel safe. They've got to have the money put in to invest in bike infrastructure so that they will feel safe. We have been calling for a number of years that we need to be spending a billion dollars over the forward estimates on cycling infrastructure. Yet this government refuses to even acknowledge that there's a role for government in funding cycling infrastructure. Every time I've raised it in estimates, I just get stonewalled. If we had a government serious about taking action on road safety, investing in that infrastructure is incredibly important. They are the sorts of measures that we need to be seeing from this government if we're going to seriously be tackling the issue of road safety.

             I too rise to take note of the government response. At the outset, I would like to put on the record that the contribution from Senator Rice in this space has been longstanding and very valuable.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the things that is really difficult is what has actually happened with this report. We concluded a report in 2016, I believe; four years later we get a response—four years later a government response. The protocol is that a government response should come within three months. That's a high-hurdle rate but, seriously, four years? One of the recommendations, which has not been accepted, is that the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transport_Commission" rel="nofollow">
              National Transport Commission
             </a>
             re-establish a national consultative committee on motorcycle safety. They don't accept that recommendation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let me tell you this: 518 motorcyclists have died since the report was handed in, and the government doesn't accept the recommendation that we should have another look at this space? Forty-one have died in my home state, so you've got to think they don't care. The revolving door of transport ministers, or whatever, may well have caused this delay in response, but to say you're not interested when 500 people have lost their lives? The awful reality is—and I wouldn't disagree with Senator Rice on much—deaths are cheap. You can quantify them. An insurance claim will come out. A funeral benefit will be paid. People and families will grieve for a long time, but they're quantifiable.
            </p>
            <p>
             Serious injuries are unimaginably expensive. The cost to the economy for serious injuries is almost never-ending. We don't actually have a system in Australia where we can quantify that. We don't have a nationally recognised system where we know how many people we're seriously injuring. The economic cost is almost immeasurable added to the human cost.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've got to say this: it's not easy to be supercritical of the other side because the Australian federal government has done this forever. Think how long it took to get seatbelts in motor vehicles and how long it took to legislate in each respective jurisdiction—nine years to get seatbelt legislation in each jurisdiction in Australia—when we were killing horrendous numbers of people. This is not news. What should be happening is: you have a really good go, a government inquiry, initiated by this government, and two or three eminent people, like Jeremy Woolley,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Crozier" rel="nofollow">
              John Crozier
             </a>
             and Lauchlan McIntosh. They go out and do the work for you and give you a template of action. Whoever sits in the Deputy Prime Minister's office, or the transport minister's office, ticks off on that; they should have a go. That's the industry. That's the world telling you which way to go. A response four years late, no action, not looking here, talking about things like social licence—we need to get the community to move with us.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have no idea which way the government's going on road safety. It's a crying shame. We are not going to get better. If we do not travel internationally, which is quite on the cards—a lot of Australians will no longer be travelling internationally for 18 months to two years—guess what? They'll finish work on a Friday night and drive to Melbourne for the footy. They'll watch the footy all day and do whatever they do on Saturday night. Then they'll try and head leadfooted back to Adelaide or wherever for work on Monday. And guess what? They're going to make mistakes, and the road toll is going to get higher, not lower.
            </p>
            <p>
             When I drove over here to Canberra, the highway from Renmark back to Adelaide after a long weekend was bumper to bumper. Caravans, boats, motorcycles, cars with canoes on top—everybody was on the road. More people on the road, less skill on the road—it's going to need a concerted effort by the federal government and all the respective authorities to ensure people are going to get there safely.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's huge investment in roads. But, with all of that investment, there's not one cent of it tied to safe outcomes. Have you got appropriate separation? Are you doing audio-tactile line marking? These issues are well known. The bureaucrats can talk to you endlessly about them. But we keep handing out large parcels of money without a tied safety outcome. It really has to stop.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know other senators have to speak on other matters, so I just want to say this in finishing. We can't avoid this. This is Australians. COVID-19 has shown us how to act cooperatively. The national cabinet that now exists and has delivered an outcome of fewer than 100 Australians' deaths should have a look at road safety in the same way. Why don't you have it as an agenda item? There are a lot more than 100 Australians getting killed on the road, and there's a huge amount of people getting injured every day.

              I rise to speak on the government's response to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
               Committee

              report,
              <i>
               Aspects of road safety in Australia
              </i>
              . I just want to go to a few issues. The report is an extremely important report, and it is disappointing that it has taken such a long time for a response.
             </p>
             <p>
              The transport industry—I'm talking particularly about trucking at this point—is an industry where there have been 901 deaths from truck crashes in the past five years. So far this year, of 78 workplace deaths, 25 were transport deaths. Those are the figures that we actually have from safety departments in various states. But because not every state counts a trucking death as a workplace death, in actual fact you could quite easily, unfortunately and horrifically, double those figures.
             </p>
             <p>
              But it does go to a particularly appalling situation, and that is the way that the industry has been responding to some of these calls. I'm going to mention something about the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
               ACCC
              </a>
              as well. This is an industry which has extremely low margins. It's under incredible pressure: some pressure from clients, some pressure from the supply chain. In one study I recall, 25 per cent of drivers were doing more than 72 hours a week. I remember being at one inquiry some years ago, in my previous life, explaining to those senators that, if I were to tie down somebody in a chair—or, if you were to tie down one of your staff in a chair—for five hours before they could have a break, as is what happens with truck drivers, then you'd be put in jail. If you were tying down your staff, giving them half an hour to get out of that chair every five hours and sitting them in that chair for 17 hours, you'd be put in jail. Truck driving is an incredibly dangerous, difficult and demanding industry, with high exploitation. Twenty-five per cent of drivers do more than 72 hours.
             </p>
             <p>
              In one study, four per cent of drivers were doing more than 92 hours. That wasn't because people were greedy or because they didn't care about the law. It's because of the pressure that comes on the trucking industry. One very brave person—he's an owner-driver, an interstate driver in one of the toughest segments of the transport industry—spoke up on numerous occasions over many years. It's a very tight business that he runs. It's a very difficult business that he runs—highly competitive, at the beck and call of clients that have little regard to the pressure they apply on the trucking industry. He was quoted recently. I will quote him from a very important article he wrote in what's called
              <i>
               Owner Driver
              </i>
              . I'm happy to say that
              <i>
               Owner Driver
              </i>
              is a bit like the Bible for truckies. If you're in a truck stop, that's the first thing you have a look at. In a recent opinion piece,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Black" rel="nofollow">
               Frank Black
              </a>
              said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              This is no time for bottom feeders to seek to profit at the expense of others. We can't afford for rates to be lowered anywhere in the industry.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              In harder times, it's more important than ever for us to stick together and stand strong. We all feel the calling of our personal financial needs but undercutting each other to win work will only do harm to us all.
             </p>
             <p>
              These seem like pretty sensible words, when you think this is the sort of state this industry is in: low margin, submarginal; people doing it tough; poor rates; vehicles not being able to be maintained; decisions about whether you keep your business running or you pay your bills at home; having your trucking business tied in with your mortgage; being away from your families for extremely long hours. All these things are a cocktail of despair in this industry.
             </p>
             <p>
              But so many drivers put energy into making sure that they make this industry work better, and Frank is one of those people. After Frank said those very sensible words, he received a threatening letter from the ACCC. They not only threatened to charge him but reminded him that those charges carry a jail term of many years. He's an elected representative for truck drivers. They've accused him of a price-fixing cartel. In three jurisdictions in this country—in

               New South Wales
              </a>
              —we have legislation that gives some onus of rights to owner-drivers, that are exempt from the ACCC. There is even the Independent Contractors Act, and, for all its deficiencies, it also can exempt collective negotiation of owner-drivers and has on occasions. But the ACCC has tried to shut him down. Why did they try to shut him down? Because some scurrilous individual—and I'm waiting for a response from the Australian Trucking Association over this—decided to do a backhander to Frank Black because he stood up for truckies.
             </p>
             <p>
              When you stand up for owner-drivers, this is the pile of dirt that gets thrown on top of you. I've got to say this to all those that are sitting back and thinking that they're going to shut people like Frank Black up, and many, many owner-drivers like him—because they won't. I've got to say this to the ACCC. Reach out, have the right arguments, have the discussions, look at the reports, look at the deaths in this industry and then decide whether you should be sending letters to people who are standing up for truck drivers and saying, 'You can't work for a rate that will literally kill you, that will literally send you bankrupt.' If that's illegal, then what sort of dope have we got in the ACCC?
             </p>
             <p>
              The Australian Trucking Association have now completely distanced themselves from Frank Black. Will they distance themselves from many drivers around this country, small businesses over a long period of time? And now they have dumped on a hard-fighting owner-driver who was on their executive. He doesn't always see eye to eye with them, he doesn't always have the same opinion as them, but he is an elected owner-driver representative on that committee. Doesn't it make you sick to think that the ACCC has nothing better to do than badger and harass a hardworking owner-driver who is saying we should stand up for small-business people, that we should stand by what we've done in legislation in other states? I've been there when Liberal governments and Labor have come together to make improvements to owner-driver protections to protect their goodwill. I've seen occasions where parliaments have come together—and even governments in control of parliaments have come together—and given owner-drivers rights controlled by conservative governments.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Australian Trucking Association, and the ACCC, have a lot to answer for this. I'm going to go through their executive because, I'll tell you what, every one of them has a tale to tell of stealing from drivers, of employing owner-drivers because they don't want to have a minimum rate so drivers can survive. They have been convicted of all sorts of atrocities in the trucking industry. And they finally thought they had got their man; they thought they would get the ACCC to play the line for them. Well, guess what? I stand with Frank Black and owner-drivers in this country. Unlike the Australian Trucking Association, and unlike the ACCC, I'm not going to see small businesses crushed and I'm not going to see people not being prepared to stand up and call it out when they're being stood over and stood on.

              I have had to go to the funerals of truck drivers, and too many of them were owner-drivers. Those deaths were not due to acts of God that occurred; they were due to acts of pressure on those drivers by clients and malicious trucking companies. I'm going to out the Australian Trucking Association for what they are doing. They deserve to be outed because we need to clean this industry up.
