Will the government continue with this $1.5 billion taxpayer corporate handout, knowing that without doubt you are enabling the expansion of gas while the planet boils?

This is public, common-use marine infrastructure, and this is infrastructure that will be needed to develop clean energy industries to get to net zero. I know that the Greens don't have to deal in government with the reality of how to transition to net zero, but we are determined, as a government, to do that. I appreciate that it's a very controversial issue locally and politically, but I think we should all take a step back and understand what is being proposed here: public common-use marine infrastructure to—

           What the! Senator Gallagher pointed out yesterday that whenever someone doesn't agree with you, you accuse them of some sort of corruption. It really is a very poor debating point. They're not a cartel, and nor are we. We just don't agree with your position on this. We actually think infrastructure that will develop clean energy industries as well as enabling Australia's gas industry is part of the transition. We don't have the same view that the Greens do on this. I'd make the point that the

           government is seeking to ensure that a range of industries could utilise this infrastructure. We think that's appropriate, and that's what the Commonwealth investment is about.

             . The science and scientists can't be any clearer. Any new fossil fuel project being built now will blow the government's net zero target. What do you choose: $1.5 billion enabling a gas export terminal at Middle Arm or your net zero target?

              I would make the point that I've made in here previously and that, I suspect, will be as successful with the Greens political party as it has been for the last decade or so. That is that emissions under the Paris agreement, under the
