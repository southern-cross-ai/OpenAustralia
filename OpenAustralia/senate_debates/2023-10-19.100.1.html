        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Mr Albanese's failed referendum campaign hurt our country no matter how people voted. Members of the Prime Minister's hand-picked referendum working group suggested that voting no was based on a foundation of racism or stupidity. Prominent 'yes' advocates declared that 'no' voters were dinosaurs, wreckers or worse. Sixty-one per cent of Australians voted no, but Australians on both sides of it were hurt thanks to its mishandling. Is the Prime Minister going to make an apology to the Australian people, regardless of their vote, for his role in dividing our great nation?

         I thank Senator Liddle for her question. It is true. There were things said and done during the campaign which were hurtful. There were things that were done and said that particularly our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         people found hurtful. There were things that were done and said which many Australians found hurtful, particularly people from Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         backgrounds, regardless of their views. We have seen a lot of pain, which is why the Prime Minister spoke about the importance of coming together on the night of the referendum, when he accepted responsibility, when he said very clearly to Australians that we're neither 'yes' voters nor 'no' voters, we are Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         I did say in this chamber that, when asked questions prior to the referendum, people bring to this campaign and bring to these questions their history and their experience, and there is a place for respecting that and for speaking with respect and acceptance and some graciousness towards each other. I think now is the time for graciousness. Now is the time to recognise those that are hurting, even if we don't agree with what they might say. Now is the time to recognise that all of us have a role in bringing Australians together. What I'd say to you is: we come to this with that spirit. I would invite you and others on that side to respond in kind.

          Almost always, and with everything, the most vulnerable are affected the most. The Albanese government spent $450 million on a referendum doomed to fail. This could have doubled annual funding for child and family services in the

           Northern Territory

Why do you continue to oppose an audit into Indigenous program funding and a royal commission into child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities when, in the Northern Territory, the torment and trauma of those children at risk—

                I think we would all agree that all of us want children to be healthy and safe and no-one seeks that abuse is ever invisible. I think you opened your question with 'doomed to failure'. You would know, Senator Liddle, that your party, for quite some time—until the decision earlier this year—supported this process. Mr Wyatt supported this process. Mr Morrison and Mr Turnbull were engaged in this process. Until recently, this did have bipartisan support.
