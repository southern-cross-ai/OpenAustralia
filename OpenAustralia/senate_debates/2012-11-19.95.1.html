       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill provides a mechanism for adjusting a long-term sustainable diversion limit (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDL" rel="nofollow">
         SDL
        </a>
        ), within set limits, without the Basin Plan going through the formal amendment process. It will provide for the Murray Darling Basin Authority to be able to adjust the limit in a way that reflects the environmentally sustainable level of take, determine that any criteria in the Basin Plan for the above purposes have been met and require a State water resource plan to reflect the adjustments to the limit. It provides that notice may be tabled by the Minister adjusting the SDL.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasons" rel="nofollow">
         Reasons
        </a>
        for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        During the Basin Plan public consultation there was strong support for a process that would enable the SDL to be adjusted without the formal Basin Plan adjustment process being invoked. The s.43A(4) consensus statement by the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council on the proposed Basin Plan included support for the development by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, together with Basin States, of an SDL adjustment mechanism.

        intent is to make the Basin Plan this calendar year. Unless the amendment is made this sitting then the adjustment mechanism to be included within the Basin Plan could not take account of the amendment.

         OTC

        derivatives should be trade reported, centrally cleared and, where appropriate, traded on-platform by the end of 2012. Therefore, passage in the Spring sittings is necessary in order to implement Australia’s G-20 commitments in 2012.

       <p class="italic">
        Australia’s framework needs to be designed to meet the requirements for mutual recognition under international OTC derivatives regimes, which are currently still in the process of being settled. There is also a need for further consultation on the details of Australia’s framework, which is why the proposed amendments need to be introduced in the Spring sittings.

        and passage of the bill in the 2012 Spring sitting period is necessary to ensure the COAG trial of Certificate IV qualifications can commence by 1 January 2013. A delay in the amendments to improve the approvals process and the provider suspension and revocation processes may jeopardise public monies paid to high risk private providers on behalf of students undertaking courses at such providers.

        The object of the NHS Act is to establish controls for the security of biological agents of security concern that could be used in bioterrorist attacks. The controls are aimed at a group of agents collectively designated as security sensitive biological agents (SSBAs). Entities that handle SSBAs must register under the NHS Act and comply with the reporting requirements and SSBA Standards.

        PERSONAL LIABILITY FOR CORPORATE FAULT REFORM BILL
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will meet deadlines set by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
         Council of Australian Governments
        </a>
        (COAG) to increase harmonisation in relation to the imposition of personal liability for corporate fault across Australian legislation in accordance with a set of principles. These reforms will ensure that personal liability for corporate fault is only imposed when justified under Principles endorsed by COAG, and are imposed in a consistent manner across Australian jurisdictions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The COAG timeline pursuant to the National Partnership Agreement for a Seamless National Economy requires that all jurisdictions develop a legislative plan to implement agreed reforms and introduce legislation by end-2012. The Government has released three exposure drafts of the Bill as part of its public consultation process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reforms in the area of personal liability for corporate fault had been in progress for some time. In addition to general concerns regarding the delays in this COAG project, the new COAG deadline has been publically criticised by industry, as well as the COAG Reform Council. In response to these views, the Government considers that passage of legislation by end-2012 would be more appropriate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To ensure that the COAG timeline is met, the Commonwealth has been preparing draft legislation on the understanding that it would be introduced and passed by spring 2012. In the event that introduction does not occur in Spring of 2012, the Commonwealth would be found to be in breach the COAG milestone that all jurisdictions plan to implement agreed reforms and introduce legislation by end 2012.
