        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Yesterday, when Senator Farrell was asked for a second time what the Labor government defined as 'mortgage stress', you interjected, 'Why didn't you ask me?'
       </p>
       <p>
        So, in that spirit, I ask again: what is the Albanese government's precise definition of 'mortgage stress'?

         As you might recall, Senator Hughes, I actually made sure I had the opportunity afterwards to say what I wanted to say, which is that, unlike those opposite, we don't need definitions to understand how hard it is that Australians are doing, which is why we are focused on the $23 billion worth of cost-of-living measures that we have put in place, so many of which you opposed and which are about assisting Australian families.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would just make this point because there's been a lot of discussion about inflation: the statement of monetary policy that the

          RBA

         has released has confirmed what the ABS has previously said. Our cost-of-living measures have shaved half a percentage point off inflation.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should listen to this. Remember what inflation was like under you? The ABS has said that our cost-of-living measures shaved half—

             I did respond directly to Senator Hume, who was, to be fair, being feisty towards me, and that's fine. I don't mind. I don't think it was abuse, and I certainly wouldn't want it to be perceived in that way.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I would make this point: the ABS has said that our cost-of-living measures shaved half a percentage point off inflation in the September quarter. That was confirmed by the

             again today. So I would make the point to those opposite: if you're serious about worrying about mortgage stress, if you're serious about cost of living and if you're serious about inflation, you should have supported the measures that the government brought in.

               Minister, I'm not sure there was a definition in there since maybe you don't know either, but, given the Minister representing the Treasurer was unable to answer, despite being asked twice, can you confirm how many Australian households are currently experiencing mortgage stress and how many more will as a result of this latest interest rate rise under Labor?

What I would say is this: given we know from the ABS and the

                that the government's approach shaved half a percentage point off the inflation rate in the September quarter, Senator Hughes, if you care about inflation and interest rates, maybe you should make sure that those opposite support the things the government is doing.

                   We will take responsibility, as the government, for doing everything we can to put downward pressure on inflation, which is why we brought into this chamber the measures to cap energy price rises, why we brought into this chamber bulk-billing changes, why we brought into this chamber cheaper medicines—why we brought into this chamber a whole range of measures that you opposed. What I'd say to all Australians is that we understand you are doing it tough and we will continue to do all we can to try and ensure there is downward pressure on inflation and to assist on cost of living.

                  <p>
                   But what we do know is that the Dutton opposition is the party of more expensive medicines and higher energy prices.
