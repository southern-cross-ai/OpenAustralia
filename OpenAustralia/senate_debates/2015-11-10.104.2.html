           This amendment is similar to the one that we moved last year about the 2015 sitting calendar. These sittings coincide with school holidays on three occasions—in particular, in July for Queensland, Victoria and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory
           </a>
           . For Queensland and Victoria, they then coincide with the school holidays in September as well. So senators who have young families, with children at school, twice will lose out on being able to spend time with their children during the school holidays. It is quite easy for us to have a calendar that does exclude sitting days on school holidays. We are supposed to be family friendly. It is very hard for us to be family friendly in this Senate. One of the ways we can be is by not calling sitting days on school holidays.

              Again, as I said in this place when a similar motion was moved last time, the Labor Party is not supporting the amendment, though we do understand the concerns raised by Senator Siewert. We say again that these things should be discussed beforehand so that we have the open discussion about the family-friendly processes. But it has been our position that the government of the day has the right to determine the sitting pattern. That is the convention we follow. In making that statement, I say that we should have certainty around the sitting hours and, should there be any requests for extended hours or changes to that, it would only be under exceptional circumstances and there would need to be consideration of that at the time. On that basis, we are not supporting the Greens amendment and we are living by the longstanding convention of putting the onus on the government of the day to set the pattern.

                 I appreciate the opposition indicating that they support the convention that the government of the day should determine the sitting schedule. Obviously this is a matter which is determined by both chambers, and it makes sense that both chambers have a common sitting pattern. It is not always possible, given that there are multiple considerations in determining a sitting pattern, to see that school holidays never coincide with sittings of the parliament. In relation to Senator Moore's comments about whether next year additional hours or days would be granted by the chamber: whether the government requests the chamber to do so will, to a large extent, be a function of whether the various groupings in this chamber facilitate quick passage of legislation.

                    did follow the protocol. We wrote to the government, asking that they did not schedule or suggest that this parliament sits during school holidays, because of the problems it created last year.

Twelve months on, it is as if those words were either (a) forgotten or (b) hollow in the first place. Frankly, I get a bit sick and tired of hearing the lip-service to how we should be encouraging more women into this parliament, when in fact very practical considerations could be made which would make it a much more workable place to be for women. I think it is appalling—
