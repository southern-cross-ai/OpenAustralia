         I might just indicate on behalf of the coalition that we will not be opposing those amendments, but note that this is yet another series of amendments to a bill which is fundamentally flawed. The government have been making it up as they go along. Just before, as the minister was concluding the second reading debate, he was essentially telling the Senate that what we desperately need is more red tape now so we can have some cuts to red tape sometime down the track. But of course we know that that time 'sometime down the track' would actually require some agreement from the states to effectively hand over a whole series of powers to the Commonwealth which, on present indications, is highly unlikely. These amendments, while they improve a bad bill, do not fix the fundamental core problem. What we would get with this bill is a massive new bureaucracy which would make life harder for our charitable and not-for-profit sector, impose significant additional red tape, and come on top of existing state regulatory arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course what the government is trying to put to the Senate is, 'Trust us, there might be this massive increase in red tape now but at some unidentified time in the future this additional red tape will help us to reduce the red tape down the track.' Based on the government's track record, we do not trust the government's assurances in relation to this. We do not trust that this massive increase in red tape will ever lead to genuine reductions in red tape. We think that, when all is said and done, this new federal bureaucracy here in Canberra, which will have its fingers in every voluntary organisation across Australia, will be there to stay, and it will come on top of all the other processes already in place at state level. In fact this is a pretty far-reaching new federal bureaucracy which will get them involved in every aspect of the charitable not-for-profit sector. So with those few remarks, I say that we will not be opposing those amendments because we do recognise that they make some slight improvements to what overall is a very bad bill. But it does not actually improve this bill sufficiently for us to be able to support the bill as a whole.

          I have a series of questions that I would like some information around that pertain to the amendments that have been moved. The amendments that have been moved are largely in response to the additional comments report that the Greens submitted during the Community Affairs Committee process.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am pleased to see these amendments. In fact, as I indicated in my second reading speech, the Greens would not be supporting this legislation unless these amendments, or significant improvements, were made. These amendments aim to improve the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 to the point where we can support it, but we need some answers to some questions first.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would also like to just correct a few of the misconceptions that anyone listening to the second reading debate would have taken away from that, particularly if listening to some of the coalition senators' contributions. One of these misconceptions was that this legislation is not supported by the not-for-profit sector. While the not-for-profit sector had a number of concerns, a lot of the concerns that were canvassed through the debate were in fact about the exposure draft and the first version of the bill. Subsequently there have been quite a few amendments in response to the community input.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would like to point out here that one of the reasons we have a committee process is so that the Senate and the House of Representatives, when they look at bills, can look at the flaws in a bill and make amendments. Otherwise why do we bother with the committee process? We have a committee process to do due diligence to look at legislation. That is exactly what happened to this legislation. Lo and behold, the government actually listened to a committee and made the amendments. So I for one think that that is a really good process and I am really glad to see our democracy operating in that way.

          I had a contribution from UnitingCare—and I do hope my voice holds out for the rest of this debate. UnitingCare contributed substantively, as did a number of other community and charity not-for-profits, to the three committee inquiries that were held into this suite of legislation. Their name was taken in vain a bit, they felt, during the debate on Monday night. They said that UnitingCare had raised some points of concern. In fact, they did through the initial process. But I would like to read an email that I have permission to read in response to some of the taking of UnitingCare's name in vain. This is from

Since that time there have been two other committees, a series of amendments made to the Bills and associated legislation, and two key commitments from the Government to anti-gag clauses and red tape reduction that have secured our support for this Bill as it stands before the Senate

          This legislation is about more than simply the establishment of a new national regulator for the sector—it is recognition that our sector has come of age. A sector which is not an arm of government nor a subset of the business sector but one which has its own identity defined by its altruistic mission and characterised by its diversity and independence.

          The introduction of this Bill together with the introduction of an Anti-gag clause legislation and amendments to the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines … are important in securing a robust and independent sector. It is important that Government legislate it's anti gag clause arrangements and implement its proposed changes to the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines to address some of the outstanding red tape issues and enshrine the capacity of community service organisations to do advocacy.

         <p>
          As I said, I have permission to read that quote. That is exactly what I have been trying to do in terms of actively engaging with this piece of legislation to try and achieve change and to reflect the comments of civil society and the not-for-profit and charities sector to try and improve this bill. With this aim, I would like to start my series of questions if that is the will of the chamber. In particular, I would like to start where Lin Hatfield Dodds was talking about the gag clauses. In particular, I point out again that, as I articulated in my second reading speech, the independence of the sector is very important to the sector and it is something that the Greens hold very dear as well. So we were particularly keen to see the government respond to that with its amendment that was passed in the House of Representatives, but that has since gone further with the anti-gag-clauses legislation, which we are pleased to see. This is particularly important because the government has a monopoly over funding arrangements. In other words, it is often the sole contractor and the sole funder, which gives it an imbalance of power in negotiating contract arrangements. We have seen that abused in the past with gag clauses in contracts, and we do not want to go back to the bad old days. So this particular piece of legislation is very important.
         </p>
         <p>
          So what I would like to ask the minister is: can the minister please provide us with a timetable for the introduction of that promised legislation, and can the minister please demonstrate how the government has engaged or intends to engage the not-for-profit sector in drafting this legislation to ensure that it is sufficiently robust to provide the reassurance that the sector is looking for that gag clauses will no longer be included in the Commonwealth funding arrangements.

           On 17 September the government announced that it would introduce legislation to ban gag clauses in Commonwealth contracts with the not-for-profit sector, ensuring ongoing positive engagement and open debate between the government and the not-for-profit sector. The government recognises that a strong, independent and innovative

           sector is essential to provide an inclusive community. In contrast to this, the Howard government tried to silence the not-for-profit sector through gag clauses. The great doyens of freedom of speech, as they always pretend they are, wanted to gag charities. So they tried to muzzle the independent voice of the not-for-profit sector, and it took the election of a Labor government to act to remove these insulting gag clauses in 2008. We are now seeing a rerun. We are seeing Premier Newman doing the same in Queensland—gagging charities. You guys! You pretenders of protection of free speech: gagging charities because they might disagree with what you are doing. It is just a disgrace and you should be ashamed of yourselves. You pretend in this chamber to be a great, great supporter of free speech. The great defenders of free speech! You have actually been gagging charities. You have actually passed laws to gag people. Don't you stand up in here and try and pretend remotely—you are an absolute disgrace.

             When we get to debate the bill, you can try and pretend the bill is about gagging the media. What you will not be able to hide from is the fact that you gag charities with legislation. You did it. We undid it.

             The government has announced that it will introduce legislation to ban gag clauses in Commonwealth contracts with the not-for-profit sector because we respect the independence of the sector. The government is currently progressing the preparation of legislation to ban these gag clauses. We are firmly committed to its delivery. Targeted consultation with stakeholders on the legislation is planned to take place during early December. The government will be introducing legislation in the first sitting weeks of 2013 with a view to prompt passage through the parliament.

              This will apply to Commonwealth funding arrangements. Where there are joint agreements between the states and the Commonwealth, is it the intent that the legislation would also apply? In other words, could this legislation also apply to funding that is made available through such joint agreements to ensure that states cannot use that funding and impose gag clauses?

                I thank the minister for his answer and I would appreciate any further information, because obviously there is a lot of money that is delivered jointly. This came up in estimates the week before last when I was in fact canvassing some of the issues around the next bill we will be debating in this chamber, the social and community services pay equity bill. There is a lot of funding delivered through joint agreements. So being able to deal with that through this legislation would give us and the sector a great deal of reassurance. That would be appreciated.

               <p>
                I am aware of the time so I am trying to move through these as expeditiously as possible. The issue of the volunteer individual directors was raised a lot in the various committee inquiries, and we flagged it in our additional comment report. Many of the organisations, as we have been discussing in the chamber second reading contributions, have few if any staff and rely heavily on volunteers to run their organisations. I note the comments from
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                 World Vision Australia
                </a>
                during the Senate inquiry that it is well accepted that noncompliance is usually a matter of ignorance or underresourcing. In light of these comments the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
                 Australian Greens
                </a>
                would expect that the commissioner would take an active role—that is what we understand from discussions in the various committees—in educating registered organisations about their obligations and ensuring that volunteer directors have easy access to plain English explanations of their duties and responsibilities under the act and how to perform. Can you tell us how the commissioner will support and educate volunteer directors and what safeguards has the government put in place through the legislation to ensure that volunteer directors are aware of their obligations?

                 The government recognises and values the vital contribution made by volunteers and volunteer directors to the not-for-profit sector. We want to encourage them to continue to make an important contribution to Australian charities and not-for-profits. As part of its role, the ACNC will provide education and guidance to relevant responsible entities, including volunteer directors of unincorporated associations, to assist them to meet the requirements under the bill. This is consistent with the ACNC Commissioner's general approach of resolving compliance issues primarily through education and guidance rather than using heavy-handed enforcement powers. This regulatory approach is outlined in the ACNC's implementation report released in June 2012. In addition, as part of the development of the ACNC's regulatory framework governance standards, the government will also be seeking important feedback on the possibility of additional protections for volunteer directors of registered entities.

                  I thank the minister for his answer. In terms of the review process, I am pretty certain this is going to be an area of ongoing concern and we are aware that there are already provisions to allow the commissioner to have regard to the size and nature of organisations and the

                  expect the commission to consider whether directors have acted in good faith and the extent to which compliance issues can be resolved through education particularly with volunteer directors and unincorporated organisations. However, we do have concerns about the extent to which the directors of unincorporated entities are exposed to legal liability on behalf of an entity under this legislation. Minister, what approach will the ACNC take in dealing with these issues that involve volunteer directors? Will the review process include an assessment of the impact that the ACNC arrangements have had on entities that are run by volunteers, particularly the impact on the ability of organisations to recruit volunteer directors? One of the points that came up through the inquiries is that this will put off people wanting to volunteer to be on these organisations.

                   This is obviously an issue where, because we are stepping into a new jurisdiction, the culture of the ACNC organisation and commissioner is vital. The government's view is that it is vital that the commissioner follow through with the education and training aspect long before any other action is needed. We would be concerned if the first step was enforcement action. We think this would lead to a culture that you are describing. So we would only envisage that these powers would be needed in the most extreme examples of misbehaviour. I think we are right to be cautious and we are right to ask these questions as the culture of the agency is very important, but we do not believe that needs to be the first step; it needs to be the last resort in the most extreme circumstances.

                    I thank the minister for his answer. As I said, I know this is an issue that is exercising the minds of a number of people. Could I perhaps bring his attention to the second part of my question, which was about the impact of this legislation, given a review of any impact that has been had on the ability of organisations to attract volunteer directors and on the functioning of organisations. So can we go to that second part of the question?

                     I am advised that the government will continually review the impact of this legislation including how it impacts on volunteer directors. The minister and I have swapped, Senator Siewert, and I come a little unprepared. I apologise for that. I had not realised that Senator Conroy, who was doing this, was leaving.

                      I appreciate the answer that there will be a continuing review rather than an overall review of the legislation. Would that be something that the commissioner might be able to include therefore in the report to the parliament that the commissioner will make annually?

                        That would be very much appreciated, thank you. Perhaps I can move on to the ACNC Commissioner upholding the objects of the act. We heard in the Senate inquiry that the ACNC Commissioner should be given specific responsibility for upholding the objects of the act and advising the minister on its implementation in the text or in the bill. Could the government and the minister please confirm that the commissioner will uphold the objects of the act? Can you please explain how they will do this and what resources will be made available for them to do that?

                          I want to go to issues around the basic religious charities. Basic religious charities are recognised as complex entities that have evolved over time in a way that is different from other not-for-profit organisations. They have been given some special status in these bills and, as a result, some different reporting thresholds and responsibilities apply to this type of entity. Some issues were raised during the committee's inquiries. The

                           Australian Greens
                          </a>
                          are still concerned that these arrangements may not provide sufficient requirements to ensure the accountability and transparency and hence maintain public trust and confidence in these organisations. The amendments introduced in the House of Representatives even further relax the non-financial-reporting thresholds for basic religious entities that operate for schools. While we are not seeking during this stage to amend the legislation in this regard, we would like a commitment that these thresholds will be reviewed when the legislation is reviewed. We would like a commitment that these thresholds will be included as part of that review.

                           First, as part of establishing the commission, in consultation with stakeholders the government has decided to provide a targeted exemption for basic religious charities, and I think the senator referred to this. The practical effect is to exempt certain unincorporated religious entities from a number of requirements under the legislation. We do believe the exemption is appropriate. As with all elements of legislation, it will examine the effectiveness of the exemption as part of the five-year statutory review of the legislation.

                            I thank the minister for her answer. I have a similar question in terms of the thresholds for small, medium and large entities. Another point of very significant debate during the various committee inquiries was whether those sizes were appropriate. You have a number of organisations that are just over $1 million and some that are hundreds of millions of dollars. That group seems to be very wide. It is the same with small organisations. There is some concern about the definitions of small and medium organisations. When I subsequently looked into it and talked to various organisations I did not hear any better examples. The other examples raised also raised their own issues. I was persuaded to the argument that it is best to see how it runs for the time being and then maybe amend it in the future. Again I am seeking a commitment that specifically that issue will be looked into as part of the process of reviewing the operation of the act.

                              Thank you. During the committee inquiry, an issue was raised about the inconsistency in the

                              on the role of the ACNC board. Can you please clarify how the board will operate and under what conditions it will be able to offer advice to the commissioner? Can the minister expand on the make-up of the board, how the participants will be selected and how the board will ensure that its membership includes individuals with strong experience in operating not-for-profit organisations? To elaborate on that a bit more, during the Senate inquiry there were issues about the board only being able to provide advice on request, and there seemed to be another element in the legislation that conflicted with that and seemed to not quite rely on the concept of the board only providing advice when requested. I seek clarification so that they are really clear on that point.

                                 That is what the legislation provides but, as we said, in practice this is unlikely to become a significant issue. If the commissioner is genuinely going to be seeking the advice of the board on appropriate matters, they obviously have the opportunity to provide that.

                                      Thank you. There was quite a bit of debate during the Senate inquiry and out there in not-for-profit land about the governance standards. I am very pleased about the amendments that are planned for the way in which the regulation process will operate. They do not go as far as we would like, which is that we wanted the process in the legislation. As I articulated during my second reading contribution, I understand the reasons that cannot happen in terms of time frame, because it is a very complex issue. These are critical parts of the functioning of this act, and I am particularly pleased that the section that gave the commissioner the power to direct an entity to act or not act in a specific manner has been taken out, because that went to the very heart of the independence of the sector.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      I have a couple of questions about the consultation process. That is an area to which we paid particular attention, and another amendment that I am particularly pleased to see is the inclusion of the consultation process and, further, the inclusion of the commissioner's role in the consultation process. I would just like to tease out here, and get a confirmation of, who will actually be the lead in the consultation process over the government's standards. Will it be the commissioner? Will it be the Treasurer or the minister? I understand it to be the minister. I do understand the process and that the minister is the final decision maker. But from our perspective it is important that the commission takes a very active role in this consultation process. That is the clear message that I have received from the sector. They want to be dealing with the commission; that is why they support a commission, because they see the commission as the body that will now be helping to look after them and helping them to enhance their vibrancy and their independence.

                                        With all due respect, that did not answer the question! I am glad that the government will seek the commission's advice, but how strongly will the commission be a lead in these discussions? Also, what resourcing will be available for it to undertake that consultation? And a supplementary to that one: will there be resources for the not-for-profit sector to be able to engage in this? This is going to be a really heavy-duty process; these go to the very heart of the operation and how it relates to the not-for-profit and charity sector. So it is vital that this particular process happens appropriately.

                                         As I understand it, under the legislation it is the minister who consults. But, obviously, that is not an unusual statutory provision and my first answer does stand, which is that we would envisage an active role by the commissioner in consultation as well as, I assume, officers of the Treasury in that process.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         I do not quite understand the 'lead' concept, to be honest. We would often have a consultation process where you would have a number of levels of consultation. That is not so unusual; you might have ministerial and you might have the different levels of the public service in any consultation process.

                                         It is not intended as part of this legislation that there be any additional resources. I am sure that you will tell me why we should do that, but it is not intended. We have made various decisions, as you would know, through supplementation for

                                          Thank you. Maybe I need to be more blunt? The sector does not want Treasury determining it; they want to see the commissioner, whose role is to support the objectives of this legislation, such as an independent, vibrant sector, cutting red tape and raising public trust and confidence. They have more trust in an organisation that is coming from the perspective of understanding the sector, rather than Treasury.

                                          I will just cut straight to the chase and say that that is the reason they want it. Quite frankly, some of the iterations of this legislation that we have seen have been because there has not been an understanding of the sector. I am not having a go at Treasury and I am not having a go at the

                                           Thank you for being blunt; now I understand! I would say to you that it is in the government's interests to ensure proper a consultation process and to ensure that the commissioner is actively involved in that. I understand that the commissioner—Ms Pascoe, is it?—is a well-regarded individual in the not-for-profit sector. I do not have any doubt that the commissioner will be engaged to ensure an appropriate consultation process. If there are issues down the track which I raised with you, Senator, you do have the option, obviously, of making sure that the relevant minister is aware of that.

                                           as well, who actually consult many members of the community across a whole range of issues. But I appreciate what you are saying: the sector want to have somebody who is really engaged with their issues as part of this process, and we would envisage that that would occur.

                                            People are now really engaging with, once the bill is in place, how the governance process and consultation process are going to roll out. I realise that you cannot pre-empt something that the commissioner will undertake, but I am wondering if it is possible that there could be an undertaking that, before the consultation starts, the development of the consultation process is discussed with the board or, more broadly, with the not-for-profit sector so that there is not a misunderstanding from the start about how that consultation process will occur.

                                                I have a series of questions, and these follow on from my spectacularly unsuccessful second reading amendment—I think I was the only voice supporting it—where I called on the government to introduce legislation detailing a definition of charities and charitable purposes and including a public benefit test within 12 months of the passage of these bills. Following on from that, can the minister provide any information on when legislation relating to the definition of 'charity' and 'charitable purpose' will be introduced, and will this contain a public benefit test? By way of background, the position in the United Kingdom, which I think is the benchmark for accountability for charities—it is something that has been tried and proven and works well with charities and the not-for-profit sector—–has included these definitions for a number of years. I support the broad intent of this legislation, but my question is: when will we go further with a definition of 'charity' and 'charitable purpose' and will it include a public benefit test?

I am not in a position to give you any public indication of the content of that at this stage in the terms you have sought.

                                                     Obviously the framework we are discussing is focused on charities. The government's intention is that the ACNC be able to fulfil the responsibilities it currently has in the legislation before considering any expansion to other not-for-profits. As a matter of logistics, the earliest point that other not-for-profits could be included in the regulatory framework would be 2014. However, it would be premature to make any decision regarding this as we first want the commission to be up and running and focused on charities and doing an effective job in that regard.

I note some of my colleagues—I heard Senator McKenzie's considered contribution yesterday—talked about concerns raised by Mr Gonski about sanctions for non-compliance amongst directors being more onerous than in the for-profit sector. I did read into the

But, given that this was a legitimate concern that was raised, can the government clarify that what has previously been raised as a concern is no longer the case in terms of the proposed framework of this piece of legislation?

                                                       The provisions of the legislation governing obligations, liabilities and offences of incorporated an unincorporated entities have been redrafted, I am advised, consistent with the recommendations of the House of Representatives standing committee inquiry. Criminal liabilities for directors of incorporated charities have been removed completely. The bill also makes clear that, where there is a non-criminal contravention of the bill, the director of an incorporated charity is only liable for any amount payable by the body corporate where this arises from a deliberate act or omission of the director involving dishonesty, gross negligence or recklessness.

                                                       I am also advised that the director liability regime in the bill is not onerous when compared with other Commonwealth acts. For example, the bill imposes no personal criminal liability on directors at all, whereas the

                                                       imposes personal criminal liability in certain situations—for example, breaches of directors duties, which may result in penalties of up to the $220,000 or imprisonment for five years or both. There are also references in the advice I have to similar types of provisions in the tax laws, which are obviously more onerous than the bill before the chamber.

                                                        Senator Xenophon, you touched on an area that I wanted to follow up, which is about the extension of this to other entities. Minister, you have already answered the first part of the question I was going to ask. You were a bit vague about the plan being to do this in 2014.

This was a major issue and the sector has been following it up very strongly about wanting to cut down red tape and whether this is going to increase it. I am pleased to see that there has been more clarification in the bill. But I still have a couple of questions that I would like to follow up on and place on the record.
                                                               </p>

                                                                The ACNC establishes a time line for reducing unnecessary regulatory obligations on the Australian not-for-profit sector, and I am pleased that, as part of its annual report, it will be detailing its progress against the time line in reducing red tape. However, the red tape issues are, unfortunately, broader than those that are just under the influence of the ACNC and while the ACNC has been given the task of promoting greater integration and fewer reporting requirements, the government as a whole has set forth its commitments to the sector in having ongoing regard to the delivery on that commitment. Will the government also commit to ensuring that an independent regulatory impact assessment is undertaken and factor in the cost of compliance with the ACNC into its regulatory calculator?

What I can say to you is that the government has a very clear framework that applies across government decisions around the need to do a regulation impact assessment, which will look at the costs and the benefits of particular policy decisions. That is the case in this area and across all areas of government policy. Where required under the framework, an

One of the proposals that was traversed was item 10 in schedule 1 of the transition bill, which states '

During the inquiry process the Bishops' Council suggested that the government should amend the statement to read, 'The Commissioner will…' and argued that this arrangement would protect organisations from unnecessary duplication as a result of the ACNC registration until other arrangements can be resolved.
                                                                   </p>

I partly accept the government's concern that taking this step to amend the text of the bill to replace 'may' with 'will' could have unintended consequences. But for all government departments there is no reason this could not be used as a standard until other arrangements are instituted, or put in place for a short-term process to see how it could operate.
                                                                   </p>

Even if you cannot amend the bill from 'may' to 'will', it is the intent that we are looking for. We are seeking a commitment of goodwill that until some of these other measures are put in place and all the harmonisation processes are achieved that for all intents and purposes an effort will be made to replace 'may' with 'will', even if it is not in the bill. Am I making myself clear there? What we are looking for is a commitment that while maintaining transparency and accountability every intent will be made in this transition process to ensure that reports are, as the government has said, 'done once, used often'.

The government's view is that it is appropriate for there to be discretion. When you are determining a document to comply with a regulatory requirement you would not want that to be mandatory, because you would want to make sure that a person is considering whether that document should comply with it. If it should comply then they have the discretion to do that. If the commissioner is doing the right thing, and we operate on the basis that they will, I do not think the issue that you raise is going to be a problem. With the alternative construction of 'will', you would still have to have an assessment against criteria, which arguably becomes a more legal type of test—'I can only do this if this ticks all these boxes'. What you have here is discretion. The commissioner has to have regard to a range of factors, but the government thinks it is appropriate for the commissioner to have discretion.

I will also put on the record that, as you articulated earlier, there has been a great deal of faith expressed through the inquiry process in Ms Pascoe, and there is very strong support for her as the commissioner. I acknowledge that on the record.

This is not just about the commission; it is also about government agencies and how the commission can facilitate that relationship between government agencies and re-using reports as much as possible. Where is the government up to in meeting those commitments that it has already made to the not-for-profit sector about reducing red tape?

I say to the Senate that we have done quite a lot of work in this area. I do not want to pretend to the senator or the chamber that it is easy to reduce some of the compliance requirements with government because, particularly in a devolved financial management framework, a particular entity might have a grant or an arrangement with two or three departments or with the same department but with different funding arrangements, and so that obviously creates a compliance burden, which is a function of the way government works. We have been doing a fair bit of work with Minister Butler, Treasury and Finance and Deregulation to try to work through some of the ways of how we can improve arrangements. You might be aware that we announced on 17 October that we would implement a report-once, use-often reporting framework by the ACNC and that we would support that with the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines. There have also been other arrangements in terms of contract management out of my portfolio from which I am happy to try to arrange a briefing. The intention is there—I do not want to overstate it, because having worked in this area for a while I know it is a lot easier to talk about red-tape reduction than actually deliver it. Delivering it requires quite a lot of work, but I think the bill before you and the commitments that the commissioner has given really indicates the approach the government is taking.

I think your comment about it taking a while to happen is the reason for the sector's nervousness. There were commitments on red-tape reduction before and it is not that the sector is questioning the commitment, it is how it is being done and, in particular, the difficulty of working across various government agencies, and the issue of providing financial reports to one organisation or to continue having to report to individual organisations on individual grants.
                                                                       </p>

The Commonwealth Grant Guidelines are administered by me out of Finance and they establish the grants policy and reporting framework for departments and agencies subject to the Financial Management Accountability Act. I can read all of the effects of that if you wish.

These changes will state that agency staff should not seek information from grant applicants and grant recipients that is collected by other inter-Commonwealth entities and is available to agency staff. In particular, they will provide that agency staff must not request information already provided to the ACNC by an organisation regulated by it. The changes also state that when determining whether acquittal reporting requirements are required for a grant, agency staff must have regard to information collected by regulators, such as the ACNC. The changes will state that if an entity provides an annual audited financial statement to the ACNC then a grant acquittal should not be required, unless the nature of the activity for which the grant was being provided is regarded as high risk.

I want to pick up on the last point about the time line. Will that include, both for that reporting process and for the long term review, the success of the legislation in reducing red tape, measures of red-tape reduction or what measures will be used to work out whether red tape has been reduced? I should say, what indicators will be used? Has that been determined, and will you determine some?
