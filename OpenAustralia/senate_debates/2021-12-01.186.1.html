        The purpose of this amendment is to insert the term 'in all the circumstances' and to remove the word 'offensive' from the new cyberbullying offence set out in clause 2 of schedule 3 of the bill. A cyberbullying offence will apply when a defence member has used a social media service or relevant electronic service in a way that a reasonable person would regard in all the circumstances as threatening, intimidating, harassing or humiliating another person.

        Committee has suggested in its report on 20 October that the cyberbullying offence be adjusted by either removing the offensive provision or limiting application of the offence to situations where there is a service connection and the need to maintain military discipline. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee also raised concern over the appropriateness of what a reasonable person would regard as the offensive use of a social media service or an electronic service. In moving this amendment, the government has listened to the concerns raised by these committees, and in response has proposed this amendment to the cyberbullying offence to omit 'as offensive or' and to substitute 'in all the circumstances'.

           Labor knows that the government has proposed an amendment to the new cyberbullying offence in the Defence Legislation Amendment (Discipline Reform) Bill 2021, set out at new section 48A. The effect of this would be that cyberbullying offences would apply when a defence member has used a social media service or relevant electronic service in a way that a reasonable person would regard in all the circumstances as threatening, intimidating, harassing or humiliating another person, but would not necessarily regard as offensive. The government says this is a response to concerns raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">
            Human Rights
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Labor will be opposing the amendment. In terms of the substance, we are concerned that the amendment narrows and weakens the proposed cyberbullying offence. Indeed, the government's own supplementary explanatory memorandum to the amendment acknowledges as much. We understand the issue that the minister is trying to address here but we are broadly satisfied with the interpretive guidance that has been provided in response to the questions from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights about proportionality in relation to this new offence. Labor will not be supporting the amendment because we do not think that removing the word 'offensive' will have the desired overall effect of reflecting the reality of cyberbullying—that is, that a lot of it does come down to offence, or content that is considered offensive. The amendment appears to rely on a libertarian freedom of expression or free speech argument that we believe is inconsistent with the need to maintain a strong system of military discipline, which is the objective of the overall bill. Labor may be open to retaining the words 'in all the circumstances as threatening, intimidating, harassing or humiliating', but we think it's essential to retain the word 'offensive'. Otherwise, this risks watering down the offence.
          </p>
          <p>
           In terms of process and consultation, we are also disappointed that the government has tried to ram this amendment through at the eleventh hour. This amendment was known about for some time, but the government provided us with it and the supplementary explanatory memorandum only yesterday, potentially only an hour or so before the bill could have been debated. This is not simply a minor or technical amendment, so this was not enough time to consider properly the proposed change.

              I can advise that the average time taken for such an investigation was 86 days. That, I'm advised, has been reduced to 56 days. In contrast, the time for a discipline officer inquiry is two to three days.

                     Didn't this support the original form of the offence that was effectively refuting any subsequent amendment? Perhaps I should explain that better. The support of the original form of the offence—was that effectively refuting any subsequent amendment?

Certainly if there were more work to be done, I'm sure the minister would look at that with keen interest.
