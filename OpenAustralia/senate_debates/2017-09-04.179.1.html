       <p class="italic">
        Automotive passenger vehicle manufacturing has been a great part of Australia's economic and social history. It has been a significant contributor to employment, to regional economies, to research and development and to Australia's exports. And it has long received bi-partisan support from Governments. The automotive passenger vehicle manufacturing sector received $18.4 billion from 2000-01 to 2014-15 through tariff protection and budgetary assistance1. This includes around $1.7 billion in assistance from the Automotive Transformation Scheme (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATS" rel="nofollow">
         ATS
        </a>
        ) to date, while the total automotive assistance including through its predecessor the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme since 2001, is $7 billion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, things changed with the decisions by Toyota (announced 10 February 2014) and Holden (announced 11 December 2013) to end their automotive vehicle manufacturing in Australia by the end of 2017, following Ford's earlier decision (announced 23 May 2013) to wind up manufacturing in 2016. Toyota and Holden have since confirmed the dates they will cease manufacturing as 3 and 20 October 2017 respectively. The manufacturers cited the then high Australian dollar, a highly competitive market and relatively small production volumes for their decisions. All three manufacturers have plans to continue an Australian presence through their other automotive industry activities such as national sales and distribution, as well as engineering services and design/product development. Toyota will maintain around 150 highly skilled engineering and technical roles in Victoria, in addition to over 1200 sales and marketing positions. This is on top of the 1750 engineers, designers and technicians retained by Ford in Victoria and the 300 to 350 design and engineering jobs
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM" rel="nofollow">
         GM
        </a>
        Holden will retain post 2017.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The future of manufacturing in Australia lies in these kind of value-adding activities, from product concept, research and development, design and production to distribution and after-sales service. Australia must remain competitive as manufacturing around the globe undergoes major transformation. The Australian Government has been on the front foot of this transition to advanced manufacturing, firstly through the successful $155 million Growth Fund, and now with the announcement of the new $100 million Advanced Manufacturing Fund which will boost innovation, skills and employment in advanced manufacturing as industries transition following the wind-down of vehicle manufacturing. The new fund will help car-related businesses move into other industries and fund tertiary engineering courses and research into manufacturing techniques.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Advanced Manufacturing Fund will include the following elements:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Advanced Manufacturing Fund is the latest instalment in the Australian Government's support for the transition of the automotive passenger vehicle manufacturing sector since 2013. The three year window for transition has provided a unique opportunity for businesses to diversify and for workers to reskill. In addition to the $100 million Advanced Manufacturing Fund, there are a variety of initiatives that have supported and will continue to support the Australian automotive industry in its transition, including those workers and businesses affected by the closures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Automotive Transformation Scheme (ATS) is a legislated entitlement scheme that provides assistance to registered participants for the production of motor vehicles and engines. The Scheme aims to encourage competitive investment, innovation and economic sustainability in the Australian automotive industry. The continuation of the ATS, as legislated to 2020, will support an orderly transition of the automotive manufacturing sector post 2017. This means, firms who undertake eligible ATS activities, including in the export side of their businesses, can continue to apply for funding during this period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        recognises while in transition, business could benefit from reduced regulatory burden of ATS participation. The Government will review the administrative regulations that impact on businesses transitioning, such as re-registering for the ATS, or changing registration categories from a Motor Vehicle Producer to an Automotive Services Provider, or registering under the national interest provisions of the ATS. The Government understands the time pressures businesses are under, and will consult with ATS participants on how best to reduce the regulatory burden associated with the ATS.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One thing must be made clear though: The decline in demand for locally made vehicles has resulted in a reduction in production volumes. This has seen a corresponding fall in demand for the ATS, so expenditure has correspondingly declined. That has led to calls for the ATS "underspend" to be redirected for other activities, such as funding for other related automotive activities such as caravans and trailers or the aftermarket component makers – sectors their respective industry associations report are growing. The ATS has a legislated cap with expenditure based on claims for eligible activity. Budget provision is made on estimated demand. There is no underspend that can be redirected for other purposes should the legislated cap not be reached, no ATS 'pot of money' to use for non-ATS eligible activities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Support is already available to these other growing sectors through other Government initiatives such as skills and training initiatives, the R&amp;D Tax Incentive, and the National Innovation and Science Agenda. The Government is focused on getting the economic framework right for further investment and job creation by businesses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The transition of the sector is complemented by the Government's successful $155 million Growth Fund, developed in response to the decisions by Holden and Toyota to end passenger vehicle manufacturing in Australia by 2017. The Growth Fund is helping automotive workers transition to new jobs, encouraging diversification by automotive supply chain firms, and accelerating new private sector business activity outside of car manufacturing in Victoria and

        Grant recipients in South Australia include LaserBond which is producing innovative mineral extraction tool products, Seeley International which manufactures evaporative coolers and air conditioners and Ezy-Fit Engineering which manufactures heavy-duty hydraulic cylinders
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The $30 million Skills and Training Initiative, open until the end of 2018, is helping automotive workers find new jobs before they are retrenched. The initiative will provide displaced Holden and Toyota and automotive supply chain workers with access to a range of information services, careers and training advice, skills recognition and training as well as support to find a new job.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Funded by Holden and Toyota, this is primarily assisting their workers, however, Toyota have specifically partitioned $3 million of their contribution for workers in their supply chain.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government also provided support for Ford workers and component manufacturing supply chain workers through the Ford Workers in Transition project which commenced in June 2013 and concluded in April 2017.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The project complemented Ford and Victorian Government transitional support for Ford workers. Pre-closure, the focus of activity through the project was on job readiness and employability skills through a range of activities. Post-closure, the focus was on the continuation of support services through outreach centres.

       <p class="italic">
        Jobs Fairs – connecting retrenched workers with local jobs
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of the Government's commitment to supporting automotive workers transition into new employment, the Australian Government has run two jobs fairs targeted at Ford workers, impacted supply chain workers, their families and local communities. The Geelong Jobs Fair occurred on 25 July 2016 with around 40 exhibitors and over 600 jobs available. Around 870 job seekers attended this event. The Broadmeadows Jobs Fair occurred on 24 August 2016 with around 50 exhibitors and over 1000 job opportunities. Over 4000 job seekers attended this event.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Employment will run another six Jobs Fairs across Geelong, Melbourne and Adelaide in 2017 to further support automotive workers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following the announcement of the closure of Ford's manufacturing operations, the Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund (GRIIF) and Melbourne's North Innovation and Investment Fund (MNIIF) were established. The GRIIF and MNIIF are joint responses by the Australian and Victorian governments, together with Ford and Alcoa, to support innovative, job creation projects that strengthen and diversify their respective regional economies and employment bases. These programmes show that the Government understands that the transition of Australian manufacturing is causing broader shifts in regional areas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The funds, as initially announced as part of a package to support the regions impacted by Ford's closure from October 2016 were each $24.5 million. In 2014, the GRIIF, comprised of the Australian and Victorian governments, together with Ford, was increased by $5 million following a contribution from Alcoa to support the region affected by its decision to close its

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Three rounds of GRIIF funding have been completed with 17 grant recipients undertaking projects supported by funding totalling $26.9 million to create an estimated 818 jobs and leverage over $213 million in total project investment. As at 31 August 2017, 897 new jobs had been created and $129.1 million had been invested.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Two rounds of MNIIF funding have been completed with 20 grant recipients undertaking projects supported by funding totalling $18.8 million to create an estimated 487 jobs and leverage over $92.4 million in total project investment.

        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        •   The committee recommends that the Australian Government work with stakeholders—across industry, unions and state and territory governments—to develop an internationally competitive automotive industry policy framework for the entire industry, recognising the strategic role the industry can continue to play in a diversified economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has worked with stakeholders across the industry on the development and implementation of automotive initiatives. The Government will continue to work with stakeholders across the industry as the automotive industry continues to transition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Automotive manufacturing is part of a broader set of manufacturing activities in Australia that are critical to the economy. The Government has a broad set of initiatives aimed at promoting innovation in the Australian economy, including manufacturing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will work closely with a range of stakeholders across industry, research, and government on the implementation of the $100 million Advanced Manufacturing Fund.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        •   The committee recommends that the Australian Government maintain the current level of Automotive Transformation Scheme (ATS) funding through to 2020-21 as provided for in the ATS Act, and allow current underspends in the ATS to be brought forward from stage 1 (ending 2015-16) to stage 2 (ending 2020-21).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government partially supports this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ATS will remain as legislated so that it will continue to support the orderly transition of the automotive manufacturing sector post 2017. The ATS has a legislated cap for a particular purpose with expenditure based on eligible activity. Therefore, there is no "underspend" that can be used for other purposes, should the legislated cap not be reached.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        •   The committee recommends redefining the ATS into a broader, automotive-related advanced manufacturing, engineering and design program that is intended to maintain skills and industrial capabilities and mitigate the loss of jobs by supporting supply chain diversification, new manufacturing investment and jobs growth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has no plans to amend the ATS. The ATS aims to encourage competitive investment, innovation and economic sustainability in the Australian automotive industry. The Government already has a broad range of initiatives that support many different aspects of Australian manufacturing such as the Advanced Manufacturing Fund, the Growth Fund, the Entrepreneurs Programme, the R&amp;D Tax Incentive and the National Innovation and Science Agenda. These measures assist manufacturers to improve different business areas from product concept, research and development, design and production, to distribution and after-sales service. This will enable manufacturers to transition to the necessary skills and capabilities needed for smart, niche and export-focused industries of the future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        •   The committee recommends that the object of the Automotive Transformation Scheme Act be updated to better reflect the current situation within industry and the need for targeted support for diversification and transformation activities, particularly in the automotive manufacturing supply chain. The new object should specify that the ATS is designed for the promotion and growth of advanced automotive industries in Australia, including: components and materials, new technologies, engineering and design for both domestic and offshore customers when that work is performed in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As noted, the Australian Government has no plans to amend the ATS. This means, firms who undertake eligible ATS activities, including in the export side of their businesses, can continue to apply for funding during this period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, the Government recognises while in transition, automotive businesses currently supported by the ATS could further benefit by reducing some the regulatory burden of the ATS. The Government will consult with participants on elements of the ATS regulations that may be a barrier to the further transition of the sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Automotive diversification is already being actively supported through the Growth Fund and will be assisted by the new Advanced Manufacturing Fund.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        •   The committee recommends that the ATS rules and eligibility criteria should be amended to encourage further investment in research and development (R&amp;D) so that manufacturers can continue to secure complex design and engineering work and to provide greater support for diversification initiatives, including (but not limited to):
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        –   amend the ATS rules to allow for the claiming of R&amp;D relating to products and services for non-automotive industry sectors to facilitate the transition of manufacturers out of motor vehicle production;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        –   amend the ATS rules to allow for the claiming of R&amp;D and engineering services across the registration categories for both domestic and offshore automotive customers when that work is performed in Australia;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        –   amend the definition of automotive services so that the concept of eligible automotive services is broader than passenger motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles (and covers all modes of mobility);
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        –   remove the once a year registration requirement to allow for ease of movement between ATS registration categories as the transition within the industry progresses; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        –   amend the ATS rules to allow motor vehicle producers to remain eligible for the scheme, even in the event of declining production volumes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As noted, the Government will consult with the sector on how best to reduce the regulatory burden associated with the ATS, to assist in the transition of the sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ATS already supports R&amp;D of automotive manufacturers and the automotive supply chain. As defined in the ATS there are a broad range of R&amp;D activities for creating new or improved materials, products, devices, production process or services that are supported by the program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The automotive industry also benefits from the broad range of existing initiatives that can support its R&amp;D activities, such as the R&amp;D Tax Incentive, the Advanced Manufacturing Fund, the National Innovation and Science Agenda, the Growth Fund,

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 6
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        •   Government must recognise that the automotive industry will endure. Given this recognition, the committee recommends that the government devote the necessary resources across a range of government departments to ensure the process of transformation continues. This includes a redefinition of the automotive industry to recognise and support the role of all sectors, including, but not limited to, motor vehicle production, component making, aftermarket manufacturing, engineering and design, servicing and smash repairs, retail motor trades, sales support and training.

       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the importance of the automotive industry and that it is currently in transition. The Government has resources across the Commonwealth with responsibility for the various parts of the industry that will continue to monitor and work with the industry as it transitions.

         <p class="italic">
          That the Senate take note of the document.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government's response to the Senate report on the future of the automotive industry has finally been tabled and incorporated two years after the Senate actually delivered its report. It has only done so in response to an order for the production of documents as proposed by Senator Xenophon. This is an extraordinary thing in itself. This pathetic, miserable response is a reflection of the government's attitude to the automotive industry. We recall that, in terms of its manufacturing component, the original producers were driven out of this country by the actions of this government. One can never forget—and this country should never forget—the statements made prior to 2015 by the then
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">

          . They treated this industry with open contempt. They made statements attacking

           General Motors
          </a>
          Holden, which led to

          withdrawing their manufacturing facilities from this country, and subsequently Toyota did as well.
         </p>
         <p>
          Recall Mr Abbott, who, when he was Leader of the Opposition, proposed to remove $500 million from the Automotive Transformation Scheme. This is part of the Liberal Party now in government which had celebrated the attacks upon the automotive industry. They were an industry that, at the time, employed 48,000 people directly and some 200,000 people indirectly. This was an attack upon an industry which, at that time, was having discussions with the Labor government about a proposal for two new models for Holden and Toyota. Two new models would be built in Australia at a time when the dollar was at a post-parity level. In these current circumstances, it would have seen that industry in a much, much stronger position now, given where the dollar is today. It would have seen an industry being able to survive and strengthen, as occurred during the world economic crisis when we saw this industry attract additional investment in this country when the rest of the industry around the world was in retreat.
         </p>
         <p>
          What we now know is that the consequences of this government's action has been to see extraordinary economic devastation across many of the suburbs of the south-east of this country. A negative annual shock of some $29 billion—that is, two per cent of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
           GDP
          </a>
          —has been predicted will be the consequence of the actions of this government. We are already seeing not just in economic terms but in social terms the extraordinary effect that the destruction of the manufacturing and automotive vehicle industry is having. We know that in Craigieburn, north of Melbourne, the applications for social security payments are at record levels. We know that, in Craigieburn, payments on social security increased by $30 million. Over 2,000 extra people are on social security.
         </p>
         <p>
          We're seeing this pattern developing in other parts of the western suburbs of Melbourne—in Werribee and in Derrimut. We're seeing it, of course, in the south-east as well. This is a pattern that's reflected around where the big automotive plants were. We're seeing it around the supply chain companies and the services industries. We know what the consequences were for Mitsubishi. Mitsubishi, I remember and I recall, closed, and my first job as minister was to actually deal with that. That was a consequence of the previous government. My first job as the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research was to reveal that Mitsubishi was closing its doors under the previous Liberal government. We know that the consequence of that was that two-thirds of workers at Mitsubishi were not able to secure work at the same level. One-third of workers never worked again and are unemployed. One-third very much work part time and one-third were able to secure some work, but only a third.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is in industry, and we're seeing the same pattern despite the efforts of the major vehicle producers to provide support for workers in their plants. We know that workers are, at this time, receiving job offers that are considerably below their current employment in the automotive industry. You do not earn a king's fortune in the auto industry. The average wage for an auto worker is $60,000 a year. In the parts component, it's $55,000. In the original equipment-manufacturing plants, it's $70,000. The average is $60,000 a year. These are not people who are excessively paid, but it's quality work and it's skilled work. These are people who set the bar for the average skill level for the rest of manufacturing. Many of them have certificate-level qualifications or advanced diplomas and many of them have university degrees. These are skilled people who cannot find equivalent work in their current situation.
         </p>
         <p>
          What have we got from this government? This report is a mishmash of underfunded, oversubscribed programs. The current measures that the government's just recently announced were 81 new applications for the $49 million that's available. There's no guarantee whatsoever that any of that money will go to auto workers or to those suburbs that employ auto workers—where they live. There's no guarantee whatsoever that any of that money will go to the south-east of Melbourne, the west of Melbourne or Adelaide. What we know is that there is no guarantee of support for the supply chains, and we know who the beneficiaries of the manufacturing growth centres that this government speaks highly of are. We know the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
           CEO
          </a>
          s. The advanced-manufacturing CEO of the growth centre's getting $485,000. The social security CEO's getting $433,000. The food and agricultural business CEO's getting $401,000. We know the big beneficiaries there.
         </p>
         <p>
          What else can we say about the great hallmark of this government's manufacturing policies and it's growth-centre strategy? What is it that they say is the measure of success for this strategy? What is it? What we have is a government that turns its back on R&amp;D, and the measures that have been proposed in this report go to the issue of R&amp;D. Tragically, the automotive industry used to be the single largest element of our manufacturing R&amp;D in this country. What's this government got to say? It blandly says: 'Of course there will be continued presence of the R&amp;D centres in Australia. That, of course, can be assumed.' No, it cannot. It verbals General Motors about what decisions it's making about its plant in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">
           Port Melbourne
          </a>
          at the moment. It actively verbals this report. It says that the decision has been made. It has not. There is no suggestion anywhere that the automotive companies will continue their support once the Automotive Transformation Scheme program money runs out.
         </p>
         <p>
          What's this government got to say on other areas? It says it's discovered that parallel imports are something we should try to stop. It's been dragged kicking and screaming to that proposition—a proposition that this report, of course, advanced. I've been arguing for it for some time—since two years ago. But this government knows that, at the first opportunity, it'll be back like a dog returning to its vomit. The neoliberals of this government will be back to try and get grey imports into this country under the guise of: 'Suddenly, we will produce cheaper cars just like they do in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
           New Zealand
          </a>
          —junk out of Japan—so that we can ensure that we have older cars in this country and reduce our capacity.'
         </p>
         <p>
          Of course, then the government says, 'We're doing great things on environmental standards.' Well, what have we got to say on that? Under the government's scheme, the zealots in the environment department have been let loose. We've got a carbon tax on motor cars now. The government says, 'No, we don't. We just put out a report and we had a bit of a discussion.' They're introducing a madcap scheme which won't even allow the Prius to get through unscathed—Toyota's Prius won't get through unscathed. But what does this government say? It says, 'Well, that's fine, because it's out there for discussion.' This report is a mishmash of nonsense because the government has no clear understanding of where it wants to go on automotive.
         </p>

          In Thatcher's Britain, it was understood what a disaster

           Margaret Thatcher
          </a>
          had been to the automotive industry in England. They came to realise in England that it didn't have to be that way. Now parties on both sides of the fence have understood the importance of automotive and they've rebuilt the automotive industry in England. It's the largest exporter of automotive parts and vehicles in Europe. It's a pity this government didn't learn that message instead of listening to the zealots and the madcap schemes from those who think it's better to destroy an industry, like they've done, rather than build the capabilities of Australians and build our capacity to actually build wealth for Australian people. They'd rather destroy an industry in the way in which this government has so deliberately sought to do. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
