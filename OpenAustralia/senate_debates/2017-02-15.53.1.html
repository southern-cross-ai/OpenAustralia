        </a>
        , Minister Canavan, our new best friend from the Nationals. I refer to reports today that Adani, the huge Indian multinational company that plans to build Australia's biggest coal mine, have been involved in corruption, tax fraud, labour exploitation, money laundering and the poisoning of rivers and coastlines. Minister, what due diligence have you done to assure the Australian community that these abuses will not be repeated here in Australia by the

         I thank Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_Natale" rel="nofollow">
          Di Natale
         </a>
         for his question. I have seen those reports this morning; I have not read every word but have looked through them. From my interpretation of them and also from the advice I have received from my department, there is nothing new in these reports this morning. Many of the issues raised by them are to do with allegations that are not proven at this stage, and others are well known and have been well known to Australian regulators now for the past few years.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think we have very robust environmental and approval standards in this country. We have a proud record of environmental protection. We have an excellent and pristine environment in many parts of our country that we all want to protect. This project has been through those approval processes at the Queensland government level and has been through those processes at the federal government level. Different political parties, as governments, have looked at these projects and accepted and approved them with very stringent conditions—hundreds of conditions, with more than 30 here at the federal level. We have done the due diligence on these projects, we have looked at those issues that have been brought forward and we have concluded that we are very confident that our laws will be upheld, that our laws are appropriately designed and that our environment will be protected.
        </p>
        <p>
         We must be clear. If Senator Di Natale is alleging that we have not done that due diligence properly through those approval processes, it is placing a slur on those public servants and independent regulators who have looked at them themselves and concluded these things. That has been the advice to government; that we can approve these projects, and that we can do so in a way that protects the environment and creates lots of economic opportunity and jobs for all Australians. I am confident that will happen and I hope this project does proceed.

Their corporate structure is not overly more complicated than others that operate in this country. I have confidence in the ability of Australia's authorities to apply our laws.

                  The ombudsman in one of the states of India delivered findings that Adani had bribed the police, local politicians, Customs, the pollution control board and the port department. In the absence of any federal anti-corruption watchdog here in Australia, how can the minister be confident that the unlawful exchange of money has not already occurred or will not occur into the future?

                   I reject any suggestion—and the Senator has not produced any evidence—that Australian officials are in any way connected with that. I think, again, that is a slur on Australian officials.

                   , I do wonder why you raise these issues about a company based in India and you do not raise the same issues about other companies that have been accused of those practices. Senator Dastyari, to his credit, has raised those issues, which are of great concern and which do concern regulatory authorities in this country who are making sure that laws are enforced.

                   are only raising issues about one company, which happens to be based in India. The question has to be asked: are they truly the champions of diversity that they purport themselves to be? They do not look all that diverse, looking at them. And they are not bringing issues to this place that reflect the diversity of the resources sector around the world. They are focussing on one company because they do not want jobs created in regional Queensland.
