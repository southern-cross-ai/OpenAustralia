        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the
        <i>
         Broadcasting Services Act 1992
        </i>
        to provide regional commercial radio broadcasters, and regional and remote commercial television broadcasters, with immediate regulatory relief to long-standing issues.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        to fulfil its commitment to reduce regulatory red tape for broadcasters. In light of the financial pressures upon regional commercial radio broadcasters, it is preferable that the new arrangements in the Bill be in place by 1 July 2020 to enable regional commercial radio broadcasters to take advantage of the new reporting arrangements for

        If this Bill is not passed in the Winter parliamentary sittings, regional commercial radio broadcasters, and regional and remote commercial television broadcasters, will continue to carry the operational costs associated with onerous regulatory arrangements and the uncertainty arising from continual delays in progressing these legislative reforms.

        With respect to the FEE-HELP loan fee exemption, it is critical that this bill be passed by 30 June 2020 to enable the department to apply the loan fee exemption to eligible students to provide confidence for current and prospective students (the loan fee exemption is to apply to units of study with census dates between 1 April 2020 and 30 September 2020) that they will not be subject to the loan fee and will be encouraged to continue or commence study in this period. This measure comes in direct response to the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and is part of the Government's COVID-19 Higher Education Relief Package.

        (NVETR Act) to reform the Australian Skills Quality Authority's (ASQA) governance structure to ensure it is fit for purpose and aligned with changes to its regulatory practice. Changes to ASQA's governance would clarify its roles and responsibilities, improve accountability, achieve efficiency of resources, and improve focus on strategic direction and performance. A key element of the new governance structure is the independent expert
