        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Carr. I refer the minister to his remarks on Sky

         The draft resolution 'Question of Palestine' is scheduled to be voted on in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
          General Assembly
         </a>
         this Thursday, 29 November. If passed, the draft resolution will accord non-member observer state status in the UN to the Palestinians. It does not confer statehood.
        </p>
        <p>
         The decision by the government to abstain on this question accords with our strong support for legitimate Palestinian aspirations towards statehood but reflects our view that the only way to a two-state solution in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         , with a strong Palestinian state side by side with an Israel with absolute security, is through an outcome negotiated by the two sides, the two sides thus having a commitment to the success of the outcome. You cannot get that through a resolution of the General Assembly, but to have voted no would have sent a message that Australia does not believe in something we do believe in—namely, statehood for Palestinians.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before I continue, let me just set the last question to rest. That is that there was some discussion of the political impact of this decision here. I say this candidly to the Senate: I do not believe that a decision on this has a political impact, because the vast bulk of Australians want a two-state solution. That is the common-sense, mainstream position adhered to by the Australian people: that there should be a Palestinian state side by side with a secure Israel. That is the view that the majority of Australians hold.

             Isn't it delightful to have a question as predictable as that? The answer is simply yes. When I phoned Mr Bleich, the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
              US
             </a>
             ambassador, yesterday, he was entirely relaxed about the Australian decision. Moreover, he made a public comment today that I am astonished Senator Abetz is not aware of. Such is their preparation for question time that he asked me the view of the United States when their view has been on the public record all morning. Senator Abetz, tactics, tactics, tactics! You will have to work harder. Last week we were of the view that Senator Brandis had fouled up the management of question time, but you have come back, when we have all wished you well, even more inept than your deputy.
