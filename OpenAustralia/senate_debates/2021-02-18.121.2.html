         The government has always been honest that, in dealing with a global pandemic, with a crisis of unprecedented proportions in terms of its economic impact right around the world, tragically not every job or every business would be able to be saved from the disruption that has occurred. The actions, however, that we've taken have delivered a remarkable outcome for Australia by saving jobs, saving businesses and, indeed, ensuring our economy is firmly back on track and progressing in a direction that we want to see for its recovery. Today we welcome the release of labour force figures that show yet again a decline in the unemployment rate in Australia. The figures show that in January the unemployment rate fell—

           My point of order is relevance. I'm sure that today the government will have the opportunity, through dorothies, to go through the job starters, unless they surprise me. But my question was specifically about job losses, and the minister hasn't come to that. How many will be lost when JobKeeper ends?

            Senator Gallagher, I have allowed you to restate the final part of the question. The question and the quotations did refer to jobs and the labour market. With respect, I think the minister is being directly relevant by talking about jobs. I can't instruct him how to answer a question.

             I hate to break it to the shadow minister for finance, but the measure of unemployment by the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Bureau of Statistics
             </a>
             is a measure of people without jobs in the Australian economy. What we saw in January was that the unemployment rate fell from 6.6 per cent to 6.4 per cent. More importantly, employment increased by 29,100 jobs in January 2021, the fourth monthly increase in a row. This is a government that has not only quite consistently supported people through the pandemic but also acted in a way consistent with principles. We said that measures we put in place would have to be temporary, targeted and proportionate to the circumstances that are there. That's what we've done with JobKeeper. We absolutely delivered an economy wide solution at the point of the pandemic's depths. We have tapered it off and we are now, thanks to the recovery that's in place, able to move to more targeted approaches.

               I note the minister avoids answering the question. My supplementary question is: Save Victorian Events, a group advocating for Victoria's $10 billion a year events industry, performed a survey earlier this month that found that if JobKeeper were to end in March, 43 per cent of companies surveyed would need to let staff go and an additional 40 per cent would potentially need to close their businesses. How many of the 493,000 businesses accessing JobKeeper will fold due to this government withdrawing support prematurely?

                I reject the idea of any concept of premature withdrawal. What this government has done is put in place an intervention in the Australian economy and in private businesses, unprecedented in its scale. The investment that we have put into the Australian economy has been unprecedented in its scale, in the dollars involved and in the nature of the intervention.
               </p>
               <p>
                And, of course, as we tightened the eligibility for JobKeeper, as the rates around JobKeeper declined, those opposite came in here each time and predicted doom and gloom. They told us at the end of September that we would see catastrophe at the end of December yet what we have seen is the Australian economy has continued to grow the number of jobs. The unemployment rate has continued to go down. Now, there will be difficult times ahead, no doubt about it, but—

                  The National Australia Bank has joined the chorus of economists and experts warning against prematurely abandoning support, saying: 'It is critical that, while support will be loosened in better performing parts of the economy, the overall stimulus package is not withdrawn too quickly.' Why is the Prime Minister withdrawing support without any plan for businesses to stay open and for workers to keep their jobs?

                   Well, Senator Gallagher clearly wasn't listening when the last budget was handed down, because there is an enormous amount of support, stimulus and activity still going into the Australian economy even past the end of March. All of the measures put in place to stimulate investment across the Australian economy—the HomeBuilder program that is providing a huge wave of activity in the construction sector, the tax cuts that we have legislated that are providing for an additional $1 billion-plus going into the pockets of Australian households each and every month going forward, and the fact that we have in place the loss carry back provisions for Australian businesses to be able to sustain themselves—are ongoing. All of these measures are ongoing past the end of March.

                   We on this side do not shy away from the fact there are difficult times for certain businesses. We are working through consultation with them. We will look at targeted approaches.
