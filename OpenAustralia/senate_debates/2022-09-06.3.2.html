            by leave—The consequences of this motion are that we would be able to ensure that both of these bills progress within the standing orders. It does allow us additional procedural flexibility, but within the standing orders, to ensure that these bills are dealt with in a timely fashion.

             President, again, if I can seek indulgence in terms of a little further understanding of what that procedural flexibility may be. I note these bills are listed as the first item of government business for the day already, so this is clearly not a motion to change the order of government business. So it's not clear entirely, from the Manager of Government Business in the Senate's explanation, as to precisely what flexibility they are seeking to utilise from this motion.

               by leave—Having the bills declared urgent bills means that, within the standing orders, we're not seeking to extend time at this stage, although we would note that yesterday, during the day when we usually get the most government time, we did not get to these bills at all. We do want to send a signal to the chamber that we are going to progress these bills and that we will progress these bills. This allows us some capacity, if needed—if we are not progressing these bills—to manage that within the standing orders. We are not seeking to gag or take away anyone's ability to speak on the bills, but we do want to send a message that we are serious about getting these bills done and this allows us some flexibility. If we were to need to move motions to progress the bills, we would have to win those motions as they were put, but it does give us some procedural flexibility for that.

                    I thank the chamber. This is quite an extraordinary motion for the government to come in and move at these earliest days of consideration of legislation from the government.
