         I have a series of questions that I'm keen to get some clarity on from the minister, so I'm just flagging that I've a line of questioning here I would love to be able to ask. Often we do each other the courtesy of allowing that. So, Minister, if I can commence with the supplementary explanatory memorandum, which was circulated earlier today.

         The intent of the updated second object of the NGER Act is to ensure that covered facilities reduce their net emissions …
        </p>
        <p>
         The updated objects now also include what we have described as a hard cap, which is covered by subsection (d). Could you please confirm that the intent of the cap in section 3(2)(d) is for real or gross emissions to be capped at the current five-year average and reduced over time?

          , for the question. Yes, the intent is that net and gross emissions are reduced. So the government, as you know, has legislated our 2030 targets, and these amendments in this bill before us now apply a proportionate share of those targets to the safeguard sector. This is a budget of 1,233 million tons of emissions from 30 June 2020 to 30 June 2030 and a single year amount of 100 megatons in 2030. These are net targets, which include the use of offsets.
         </p>
         <p>
          We are also committed to reducing gross emissions overall from safeguard facilities tested on a five-year, rolling-average basis, and this bill is crucial to that task of reducing onsite emissions as it creates safeguard mechanism credits.

            Since the safeguard started, total safeguard emissions have risen by around four per cent. The current five-year average of annual emissions is around 140 megatons, noting that emissions have been down somewhat in recent years as a result of the pandemic.

            <p>
             Can the minister also please clarify the other parts of that same paragraph, number 3 on page 10 of the supplementary explanatory memorandum, which states that, in order to reduce the aggregate emissions, changes to the rules shouldn't be made to reduce the number of designated facilities? Our understanding of that paragraph, and that's what I am seeking your clarity on, Minister, is that making clear that the thresholds for facilities to be covered by the scheme from 100,000 tonnes shouldn't be raised artificially to remove facilities from the scheme rather than changes to baselines or offsetting to reduce a facility's emissions. Is that correct, and can you provide an explanation of the intent of that paragraph?

             <p>
              In broad times, yes, that's correct. What we're saying here is that any attempt to adjust coverage thresholds in the legislative rules for the scheme to show a reduction in total emissions from all covered facilities would not be consistent with the object of the act. The object is to reduce emissions from these facilities. It is not to exclude facilities by rule changes when those emissions would still occur in Australia and contribute to our national targets. So any rules that were made for such an improper purpose would not be consistent with the rulemaking test to be implied under the bill.

                  . We will consult by mid-2023 on guidelines for how international best-practice values will be set and then consult on the setting of specific factors during the second half of 2023, with the aim of having best-practice values set by the end of 2023. The guidelines will apply to all values and we will work with stakeholders to ensure that we've prioritised necessary values. This will include considering the likely entry of new facilities across safeguard sectors to ensure all values are in place for the required 2023-24 compliance year.

                    , the answer I've provided provides a principle, which is that we would work with stakeholders to identify priorities and, as part of that, we'd consider the likely entry of new facilities across safeguard sectors.

                     <p>
                      Thank you for your patience in allowing me to seek advice. I think we expect that there may be iron ore projects coming on in that 2023-24 compliance year, and lithium in the 2024-25 compliance year. That is the advice at this stage, but, as indicated, we would work with stakeholders and it may be that there is other, or different, information available to us.

                       <p>
                        The government will direct the Clean Energy Regulator not to issue future credits to human induced regeneration projects until the regulator is satisfied that the project complies with recommendation 8 of the review. The government will also direct the regulator to prioritise the integrity of these projects by appointing independent auditors in relation to human induced regeneration project gateway reviews. That would be under section 215 of the existing act. These checks would ensure that vegetation in the project area is growing as expected and as required by the method and the Carbon Farming Initiative, or

                        Senator Waters, you asked how many existing projects this affects. It is as many as 371, but we have no reason to believe these projects aren't in compliance with the criteria set out in recommendation 8. In a strict answer to your question, it is 371.

How long do you expect it will take for those projects to meet the higher standards laid down in the Chubb review, noting your commitment to implement rec 8 there?

                          The way the scheme works at the moment is that a registered project—and I hope that I have my terminology entirely correct; I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong—approaches the

                          at various points in time to seek crediting based on the activities that have been undertaken. It's anticipated that that compliance check we've been referring to in this most recent of exchanges would occur at that point in time. It's a little dependent, therefore, on the way those project proponents come forward and approach the CER.

                            I think this is a question of terminology but the agreement is to implement recommendation 8 of the Chubb review. That doesn't ask for a revision of the methodology; it provides guidance about how the method should be interpreted. I think you'll know that the recommendation goes through three points:
                           </p>

                            The method should be interpreted as requiring:

                            The process I've described will see those principles applied at the point in time that project proponents come to the Clean Energy Regulator seeking to have their credits allocated.

It also indicates that the CER should, as soon as feasible, include nominated suppression mechanisms and eligible HIR activities for new and existing projects on the project register. We are confident that the CER is in a position to implement the recommendation and we expect them to do so.

                                         Perhaps I can provide some background about the safeguard transformation stream. It will provide dedicated funding for projects that reduce emissions at facilities that are trade exposed. It will support projects that reduce emissions covered by the safeguard mechanism, i.e. the eligible facility scope 1 emissions. It's intended to be technology and project neutral. It could support a range of project types like energy efficiency upgrades, shifts to lower carbon processes or fuel switching. Funding through this stream would reduce the capital costs for safeguard facilities to invest in new low-emission technologies and then fast track their adoption. By reducing safeguard facilities covered emissions it can reduce the ongoing cost for trade exposed facilities to meet their falling baselines.

There are no program guidelines yet established for these programs. They will be developed in the coming months. The delivery vehicle will also be considered in the context of the budget.

                                             The answer is a mix, dependent on the applicant and the circumstances they are facing. Largely co-investment, but there may be circumstances when another approach is suitable.

                                              coalmines are scheduled to close in the next decade, but it's anticipated that the vast majority of them will seek extensions of time but possibly at lower rates of production. Most extensions are controlled actions under the

                                              Act when it's an expansion, but my question pertains to extensions in time. Given that they're extensions in time rather than in scope, and given that they're likely to have lower scope 1 emissions than the 100,000 trigger—even though emissions from the whole project will still be over the trigger—I want to know how those coalmine time extensions will be treated by the pollution trigger under the safeguard mechanism.

                                                There is just one point of clarification there. Thank you; I understand that process. But I'm interested in what will happen when the scenario is an extension of time of an existing facility which would emit scope 1 emissions below the threshold, despite applying to a project that is cumulatively above the threshold and ergo is covered by the safeguard mechanism. I don't know how the

                                                Act would treat that, because it's not an expansion in scope; it's an extension of time with a reduced production output. So I'm interested in how those extensions would be treated by the hard cap and by the pollution trigger in the safeguard mechanism.

                                                 I think it's difficult to provide a clear response in relation to that scenario, because it would be a little bit dependent on a number of things, including the nature of any regulatory interactions it had with the state

                                                   Before we were interrupted by all of the other proceedings of the Senate, I asked a couple of questions about modelling and particularly about what analysis or modelling had been done on the amendments that had been agreed to by the government, or indeed introduced by the government, as a result of the broad conversations that occurred in the intervening period. Obviously, I remain interested in understanding exactly what level of work and in-depth analysis and modelling has occurred, because, as the minister said, a lot of work went into developing these policies and these laws post election, so it would be horrible to see this whole thing derailed by something that hasn't been analysed properly or thoroughly.

                                                    Thanks, Senator Duniam. I think there is an underlying premise in your question: that the amendments before the chamber today substantially depart from the model that was presented earlier. In truth, as we've been very clear about in our public commentary on the process we were going through, we have been willing to take helpful suggestions that strengthen the policy intent and the implementation arrangements for the proposal we took forward. We think that the additional reforms that are before us today in the form of amendments are sensible. They provide arrangements in relation to transparency and certainty in the operation of the mechanism. But the fundamental analysis is as I have already described it to you.
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p>
                                                    There was, as has been discussed at estimates and in the committee process for this bill, some modelling work that was undertaken around opportunities for onsite abatement on facilities. There has also been very broad consultation over a very long period of time with a very broad range of people. I do note that a broad coalition of business leaders and groups support the reforms, principally because they provide policy and investment certainty for large emitters. It's also the case, and it has been widely noted, that around 170 facilities already covered by the safeguard mechanism are already covered by net zero commitments that they have made in response to other drivers in their businesses. That represents 86 per cent of scheme emissions, and a third of the publicly listed companies that are in safeguard facilities use an internal carbon price for investment decisions, with half using a price of more than $100 a tonne. These things are already part of business decision-making, and the feedback that we have has been overwhelmingly supportive of the approach.
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p>
                                                    In part that is because the proposed reforms have been designed to provide sufficient flexibility to moderate and mitigate any cost impact. I point to three features of the scheme: the hybrid approach to setting baselines moderates the initial scheme impact while encouraging production to occur where it's less emissions intensive, which lowers the overall economywide cost; there are flexible compliance options, including borrowing, multi-year monitoring and the use of domestic offsets which will help safeguard facilities meet their obligations at a lower cost; and, as we have just been discussing in relation to the Powering the Regions Fund, assistance will be available to ensure businesses are not competitively disadvantaged.
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p>
                                                    I make this final point: there are costs that arise from inaction, and so, without a credible domestic policy to reduce industrial emissions, Australia's exports may increasingly be subject to import tariffs or to carbon border adjustments imposed by our trade partners. As I think former Treasurer Frydenberg said rather publicly, Australian businesses may also face increased capital costs in an environment where global financial institutions and decision-makers are taking coordinated steps to align investment with the transition to net zero.

                                                     I appreciate that response, although, whether changes are significant or small, this is a significant piece of legislation which will have significant impacts on the economy. If we are to take the government at their word, it's changing the landscape and providing certainty et cetera. To that end, beyond what had been done for the existing legislation—the consultation and analysis that you referred to—surely the government has sought to understand what impact the changes, be they large or small, will have on business so that they can provide that certainty. We received the amendments this morning with the supplementary explanatory memorandum, so, on that basis, to satisfy myself that what you're saying, that it will be all okay, is correct, I would be interested in knowing what modelling has happened. You referred to the cost of not doing anything. Has there been any analysis or quantification of those costs with regard to sea bans or other important tariffs? Do you have any examples of the costs that might be imposed on any particular industry that you could enlighten us with?

                                                      In my answer just now I stepped through the approach that the government has taken. There has been some modelling undertaken internally between the department and the Treasury. There has been a design process which has sought to provide flexibility to mitigate the cost impacts. There has been wide consultation to properly understand businesses' circumstances and the way that the proposal would interact with existing businesses covered by the mechanism. As I've indicated, there are potential costs of inaction, and they were alluded to by a former Treasurer in a government that you were part of.

But I think it is certainly the case that there is a global move towards investors making quite substantial requirements in relation to decarbonisation, and Australian businesses are not immune from that.

What you did step us through was all of the work to the completion of the bill as it was presented, prior to any changes, and I appreciate that. I've talked about the fact that that appears to be a very in-depth and thorough process. What I was asking about was everything from that point in time to the end product, such as the changes we have here that have been asked about by the Greens. I think you're telling me that, as its the government's opinion that they're not significant departures from what was there, there has been no modelling undertaken. You said there was no capacity to provide information borne out of modelling or analysis around costs to businesses relating to any of the changes to the bill that have brought forward through these negotiations. I'd be interested to have that compare and contrast with the cost of inaction. You referred to former treasurer Frydenberg's contribution to the public debate on this. What are those figures? It should be a like-for-like thing, particularly with the various international agreements we are reaching, the trade arrangements. There must be some capacity for you to step us through what the cost of not doing something is, compared to doing what this bill proposes to do.

We have been through a long process of consultation, and amongst the changes that Minister Bowen announced recently were changes to the threshold that would allow emissions-intensive, trade exposed industries to access a—how shall I characterise it?—less ambitious decline pathway in recognition of their significance and the challenges for those businesses in meeting that pathway.

Are they struggling? Have they said to you that they will struggle to achieve that, regardless of what the figure is that you will set for them?

Those changes involve a number of things, the most significant of which, perhaps, is a change to the test that applies to establish whether they are requiring some kind of concession in the targets that are applied to them.

We are very determined to truly understand the businesses that are covered within the safeguard mechanism. One feature of this mechanism is that it does cover hard-to-abate sectors and it needs to be designed in such a way as to provide incentives for those sectors to start the transformation that's critical for their long-term competitiveness, but also in recognition of the technologies that are available to them at this point in time.

I noted that you said that Treasury had done no modelling of the economy-wide impact of this policy. Who did what modelling on what, where? So, if Treasury didn't do it on industry-wide or economy-wide—without giving us the modelling, what modelling has been done and by whom?

I'll happily receive that when it comes through, because it is an important part of the consideration here. We operate as part of a global economy. We have global environmental obligations. I want to make sure what we do fits in and doesn't unfairly penalise us.

On that, we might look to explain the difference between the price outlined in the Powering Australia policy document and where the government has landed with what is proposed here.

I was seeking to explore that point.

Essentially, the bill updates the arrangements for a civil penalty that a facility would incur if its net emissions were higher than permitted. That would be described as an excess emissions situation. As you'd understand, excess emissions could impact our climate outcomes, so the penalty should be proportional both to the length of delay in meeting the requirements and, importantly, the quantity of excess emissions. Previously, the penalty for an excess emissions situation depended only on the duration, not on the relevant quantity.

The maximum civil penalty will be set at one penalty unit per tonne of excess emissions every year. I am trying to seek information—staff very helpfully point out that this is set out in the EM, which says it:
                                                                                       </p>

For an individual, the existing penalty is 20 per cent of this amount—
                                                                                       </p>

                                                                                       </p>

We talked about wilful noncompliance with the baseline. My simple understanding of this is that the business is in breach because it can't meet the baseline—the 4.9 per cent per year through to 2030—and it can't access offsets because the market may not have them available. The new piece of information to my mind is that the government is going to make available capacity to cover any business that can't find them elsewhere, which to my mind says that there will be no-one paying the penalty unless, as you said, they are wilfully in breach, which talks to almost some sort of criminal mental intent. If you could just explain that, I'd be grateful.

Ultimately a decision about whether to find a business in breach would be a decision for the regulator, and they would step through a series of processes. However, to date compliance with the safeguard mechanism has been 100 per cent. It's not our expectation that covered facilities or covered entities wish to do anything else but comply. All of the design features of the scheme were designed with close consultation with the regulated community to create circumstances where they can comply, and the cost containment measure is part of that, as are the borrowing arrangements that would allow an entity to borrow some of their future entitlements within a five-year period and also the trading arrangements that would allow them to purchase safeguard credits from other participants in the safeguard mechanism.

Obviously, there's a framework for decision-making for the regulator to view these matters through, and they step through a decision-making process. You're telling me that, if you're in breach and you can't get your offsets, one way or the other, you don't automatically get a penalty. That is an important difference. I wasn't aware of that. Are you projecting no revenue based purely on historical experience or because you believe the framework for decision-making will ameliorate the need to impose penalties in the future?

Is it going to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, or once you meet this test you then get an adjusted baseline which is X per cent as opposed to 4.9 per cent?

Trade exposed baseline adjusted—perhaps I can take you through all of it. It is the subset of trade exposed facilities that can demonstrate that their costs are above a specified threshold. Facilities will have a different framework depending on whether the facility is manufacturing or non-manufacturing, which is why I made reference to the need to make such a determination in the rule. That differential treatment between manufacturing and non-manufacturing reflects stakeholder feedback on the differences between the two in terms of their margins and their capital intensity. For non-manufacturing, the proposed threshold will be based on scheme cost as a percentage of facility revenue. As a I indicated for manufacturing, the proposed threshold will be based on scheme cost as a percentage of facility

That simply reflects the differences in the way that these businesses are organised. Either way, trade exposed baseline adjusted facilities can apply for a lower baseline decline rate. The policy rationale for that is that these facilities face concentrated impacts under the scheme and present a genuine risk of carbon leakage. So the minimum baseline reduction for non-manufacturing activities will be two per cent, and it will be one per cent for manufacturing. That baseline would be locked in for three years.

Yes, it is a sliding scale which operates between the standardised expectation of reductions of 4.9 per cent and the minimum of either two or one depending on the category and entity that we're talking about. You asked about the means by which that baseline would be established. Each year the facility would apply, so it would have a forward baseline established for the forward three years, but that would be reassessed the following year, if they wish to.

You've just mentioned that ammonium nitrate is now a carve-out. My understanding is, taking some time so there can be conversation, that Orica may have been in discussions with the government and received some sort of carve-out on the understanding that with some grandfathered contracts to 2029 there may be a carve-out in this form, or some other legislation or delegated legislation to come. Could you tell me how that might come about, what form that is in, and how we could give certainty for that investment decision into Gladstone if that is the case?

My understanding is that the government has been in discussions with Orica about their particular circumstances and, having reviewed the contractual arrangements that are in place for them, has indicated that it will be possible to grandfather that arrangement due to the existing contractual circumstances and their arrangements with the government.

The $600 million was announced in January as a consequence of consultations. As I have indicated on many occasions throughout this debate, we have been in very close consultation with covered sectors. The additional resources, the $400 million announced recently, is again as a consequence of those discussions with stakeholders and their articulation of what would be required to support them through this transition.

The government is very firm in its commitment to establish arrangements to support manufacturing and industrial activity. The safeguard mechanism is part of that. It is about providing the certainty that is necessary for those businesses to make the necessary investments to remain competitive in a world that is decarbonising. The National Reconstruction Fund is part of that. It is about providing resources to ensure that we continue to be a country that makes things—and, frankly, makes more things than we do at the moment. The Powering the Regions Fund, more broadly, is designed to provide support for the transition, and notwithstanding the specific allocations for safeguard facilities, safeguard facilities will also be eligible to apply for the other resources in the Powering the Regions Fund.

If you do your maths, they're indicating that $1 in every $10 required to be spent on the transition is going to be a significant impost on business to be able to make the transition. I wonder whether that sort of feedback, as part of this very broad consultation which has taken in the views of stakeholders, was considered as part of what government looked at as it moved into setting up these funds? If you could indicate to me whether that impost on business—$9 out of every $10 coming from a business to be able to transition, as opposed to $1 out of every $10 being the support from government to get to where the government and the world want them to be—has been factored in and, indeed, whether there is any assurance that a lack of support isn't going to result in a reduction in investment, a loss of jobs, the passing on of costs to consumers. Those sorts of things are what we're concerned about here, and based on the feedback of one significant employer, one significant contributor to our economy, it sounds like there are going to be some big costs.

I do note that Rio Tinto, prior to any obligation imposed by the safeguard mechanism, have their own commitment to net zero by 2050, and that's a commitment that they've made to their shareholders and investors. More broadly, can I just bring a sense of reality to this debate. We have gone through 10 years where the business environment for many of these businesses was terribly uncertain as a consequence of your government's—the previous government's—inability to land a climate policy or an energy policy. I well remember the many Senate inquiries that I attended when these same businesses came before us and said that what they desperately wanted was certainty and that was the thing that would unlock the investment that you're speaking about. For example, I remember when Energy Users Association of Australia said:

Banks have put away their cheque books on energy projects. Policy uncertainty has rendered electricity generation projects unbankable. That cost has been masked because lower demand has meant we haven't needed new projects but where new assets are needed, that risk premium will be there and it will push up electricity prices.

So, we're happy to have a sensible discussion about how we might best do this—what the best implementation arrangements might be. But I do think we have to have a sense of reality about where we are now and how we got here.

That's why I'm very concerned about the parallel universe in which this deal was struck up, which is why I've been asking these questions. And while I appreciate the gratuitous political points being made about the last 10 years, this is about looking forward. You won the last election. I find myself on this side of the chamber asking questions of the government about their policy—what it's going to do and how much it will drive up power prices. I can run through the record of power prices in the last term if you want, but that actually doesn't assist us in understanding what this legislation is going to do.

I would be interested to get a sense of how entities would be able to access support through these funds. What sort of process? Who do they speak to? What sort of application form? What thresholds? Any data of that nature would be helpful. And then perhaps I might look to Senator

I know you said that the delivery mechanism for the Powering the Regions Fund will be decided through the budget process. I accept that. My question is whether you've had any feedback from industry or regulators—or from any quarter, really—that the grants hub for hydrogen hubs and modern manufacturing initiative programs are substandard vehicles for getting projects up and running and whether that's therefore factoring into your decision-making when you decide on the delivery mechanism for the Powering the Regions Fund.

Sometimes a grants hub is a suitable way of doing it, and you will be aware that the grants hubs across the Commonwealth administer quite a wide range of projects. In this particular case we are simply working through the best arrangements to distribute the resources in the most effective way, given the particular policy task before us.

It is this: if in a financial year the environment minister approves the taking of an action for the purpose of a controlling provision within the meaning of the act; and the environment minister is satisfied that the action is likely to result in an increase in the financial year or future financial years of scope 1 emissions of greenhouse gases from the operation of a designated large facility for the financial year or a new designated large facility for the financial year or a future financial year; and the environment minister has been given an estimate of the scope 1 emissions of greenhouse gases from the taking of the action in one or more financial years, they must give that estimate to the minister, the climate change secretary and the

Ergo, in my scenario, where I put to you that the time frame for the operating coalmine would be extended and therefore there would be an increase in emissions but it wouldn't itself be above the 100,000 trigger, I interpret what you've just read out as saying that that increase would therefore trigger the need for the environment minister to pass on the number of those projected scope 1 emissions, which will then be treated in the fashion that you've taken us through—namely, it will be checked against the hard cap.

As has been put to you on many occasions, there is something a little odd about being questioned about our determination to put downward pressure on electricity prices when every single member of your party room voted against concrete measures to reduce electricity prices, put downward pressure on electricity prices, in December last year.

Then there's this basic principle around supply and demand, the economics of supply and demand, and when you don't have enough supply you can't meet demand. We need these inputs to be able to generate energy, given the way our energy mix is generated at the moment.

I think Santos is aiming for net zero by 2040. I think Shell is aiming to halve their emissions by 2030. These entities, these important participants in Australia's energy system, are already on this pathway. I think you should reflect on whether the claims you are making are really aligned with the publicly expressed intentions of the companies that you are talking about.

Obviously the laws we make in this place have an impact on the cost of doing business. That's what we've been talking about. You've just told me that I am wrong for suggesting that anything we do here has an impact of that nature. I'm asking about Australian farmers who are relying on this business. I just wonder whether, as part of the broad-ranging consultations that have occurred that you've talked about, whether this sort of thing, with the stakeholders, the

Has there been any assessment of the financial impact of Labor's changes to the safeguard mechanism on farmers that grow these crops?

I guess the answer is—and that's why I am reluctant on to comment on individual facilities—that the impact of these reforms will vary between facilities within these sectors. Some facilities that have a lower emissions-intensive production might receive safeguard mechanism credits. They would be able to sell those to other safeguard facilities. As we have already canvassed at length, trade tailored assessment is available for trade exposed facilities.

Minister, can you indicate whether the government accepts that there's a close correlation between, for example, fertiliser price increases and how much Australians pay for their groceries and, to that end, if there is an increase in the cost of doing business for Incitec Pivot, for them to produce the product that farmers rely on, that that would then be passed on to the consumer? Is that something that has been contemplated and potentially concerns the government?

Indeed, in the October budget fruit and vegetable prices were estimated to be eight per cent higher than what they would otherwise have been. It was a consequence of the flooding events at the time. The truth is that climate change is resulting in increased frequency and severity of severe weather events—drought, flooding, fire and storms. These events do disrupt supply chains, impact productivity and increase insurance costs for business and consumers. I raise this because it's an example of the mistaken analysis of looking at only one variable in the costs that are affecting Australian consumers. We are going through a period of change in what's expected from the investment community, in our global market, in our global supply chains and, frankly, in the operating environment, particularly for Australian farmers. We understand and major agricultural producers understand that the transition towards net zero is extremely important because it impacts, more than most sectors, the ongoing capacity of the agricultural sector to produce food and fibre.

Of course, in addition to those increased costs relating to fruit and vegetables that you mentioned, Minister, the ABS indicated that the cost of bread and cereal products has increased by 12.2 per cent over the last year, the cost of meat and seafood has increased by 8.2 per cent and the cost of dairy and related products has increased by 14.9 per cent. So it's across the board, and I accept that there are variables and many inputs. But, just because there are other impacts on the price, including climate induced flooding or drought, that doesn't mean we should then up the price or put pressures on industry elsewhere. I'm going to move off the farming component now, and I might go to some broader questions around facilities, if I may. Of the 215 facilities captured under the mechanism, how many had existing plans to reduce their emissions by 30 per cent by 2030?

I will give it one more go, which is to say that it is undoubtedly the case that the government has engaged deeply and over an extended period of time with the regulated community in relation to this reform. We have talked about the many activities that took place—the round tables, the public consultation, the written consultation, the targeted meetings—because the government does seek to deeply understand the plans and commitments of the businesses that are engaged in the safeguard mechanism. That involved talking to them about their plans. Did the department gather exactly the data you are requesting? Perhaps no. But I don't think you can deny that there has been deep and sustained engagement over a long period of time with the covered businesses.

I just wanted to pause, because your characterisation of the arrangements was not quite accurate, and I thought it best to give you very specific information. New gas fields supplying existing liquefied natural gas facilities will be treated as new facilities, regardless of their ownership structure.

I know Senator David Pocock has some questions, so I'll just ask this one, which I suspect you may not be able to answer. I just want to know whether the financial data that was used to model the impact of the safeguard mechanism on individual safeguard facilities was information relating to the facilities, or whether it was information relating to the corporate entities that owned the facilities.

I have on successive occasions given you and also Senator Hughes some indication of what work was done. I've also indicated that it was cabinet-in-confidence and commercially sensitive. I don't intend to have any deeper discussion about the content or the nature of the modelling.

We have sought the information. Even offering a private briefing on the way through might have been handy. But it's been put to me that the information used to underpin the modelling was corporate data rather than being reported by facility. I would appreciate it if you could confirm otherwise, but to my mind that might skew the data that underpins the modelling. It's hard to pursue this properly, because we are operating without access to the information. You've explained why, and I'm not going to ask you to table it or go into detail on it. But if an assurance can't be provided that that information, as I've just characterised it, wouldn't result in a skewed outcome—that is, that it is facility as opposed to corporate, which is what I'm told would be a better arrangement—then I think we have some concerns. So I just wonder if you can provide that assurance that the information provided—the financial data—was by facility. I don't want to know what it said or have it tabled; I just want to know that it was by facility, as opposed to a corporate-level piece of information.

We are seeing the impacts across the country. Our farmers are feeling the impacts. Their profits are down 20 per cent since the year 2000 due to climate change. This is here. This is 1.1 degrees of warming that we're living with, and the consequences of moving beyond 1.5 degrees of warming are stark. We know that there are tipping points for cascading climate breakdown, and failure to take action is morally irresponsible.

This mechanism only covers the 215 heaviest emitters, as we have heard. We must ensure that we keep that in mind because it is very clear that this mechanism is not in line with the goal of 1.5 degrees of warming. It's a start, but our ambition is not enough. Furthermore, the whole mechanism is built on offsets, which we know should only be used as a last resort. In this policy, they're available without restriction. As has been noted, the only other country which allows unrestricted offsets is Kazakhstan.
                                                                                                                                                                                    </p>

This reform, while far from perfect, is a substantial step in the right direction. The reform will put downward pressure on emissions from the industrial sector, and that alone is the big change. Finally, businesses will have better incentives to invest in new technologies and decarbonise. For too long in this country the business community has been ahead of government on the issue of climate change. The businesses I speak to want to decarbonise to give themselves the edge in a competitive international environment. Many of our major trading partners are moving away from fossil fuels and starting to look for low- or no-carbon products.

We need to incentivise decarbonisation so the businesses we want to form part of our future are able to decarbonise and remain here in Australia. I welcome the government's commitment to provide an additional $400 million from the Powering the Regions Fund to assist strategic industries like steel, cement and aluminium to decarbonise. But the reality is that the billion-dollar total is a drop in the ocean when it comes to the capital cost of technology transition and decarbonisation.

People around the country want us to take a step forward—a step that will result in actual reductions in emissions. They are clearly frustrated with the politics of climate change and want to get on with the job of making our future safe. My sense is that they want to step forward—a step in the right direction, even if it does not go far enough. This policy, despite its flaws, is a significant step in the right direction. Our heaviest emitters will reduce their net emissions by more than 200 million tonnes between now and 2030. Total emissions will come down. New fossil fuel projects will find it more difficult to set up, extract our resources and send them—along with hefty profits—overseas, while they continue to damage our climate, the climate that we share. And on the back of this new green industries will develop.

Throughout discussions and negotiations with the minister there was much we did not agree on, but it was clear where the minister stood, and I thank him for the way he approached our conversations. Ultimately, a point was reached where I'm satisfied that the reform is a substantial step in the right direction, but we need to move a lot faster. This is just a step.

There is so much work to do, from fuel efficiency standards to electrification across households and businesses, and the setting of a far more ambitious 2035 emissions reduction target.

As I said, to save the Senate's time I will foreshadow them now. Amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 1903 revised circulated in my name improve the way that offsets are used under the reform. Offsets are a very necessary part of this but should be reserved for hard-to-abate industries. They should only be used as a last resort, and this amendment will make sure that is the case.

If we're going to have a market mechanism, I don't see a reason to put a ceiling on the price. If you're going to use the market to try and fix this, then it really doesn't make sense to cap it and, in doing so, potentially expose the Commonwealth and taxpayers to a liability should the Commonwealth run out of ACCUs.

This will drive onsite abatement and bring forward investment in decarbonisation. If we're not going to have a hard cap on ACCUs there is provision in the regulation-making powers for the minister to discount ACCUs, referred to as the four-fifths rule, and I really believe this would be a valuable tool in imposing a carbon mitigation hierarchy which is well-established and acknowledged around the world. It makes sense for Australia to have one of them embedded in this legislation.

This is simply an accountability measure that will improve the integrity of the carbon market. There has been much conjecture about certain methodologies. This whole reform hinges on integrity in offsets. It makes sense to me that people should be able to go through the process of challenging projects should they think that there are issues.

I have concerns that it is shifting a huge amount of emissions reduction onto the land sector rather than abating them on site.

The number of projects associated with human induced regeneration is 371. There is no reason to believe—well, perhaps I'll start with what the commitment is here. We have committed to the Chubb review. The Chubb review's recommendation 8 makes a series of recommendations about how the human induced regeneration method should be interpreted by the

But, in truth, we have no reason to think that these projects are not already in compliance, and we expect how this will be implemented is that when they go to the Clean Energy Regulator to seek their credits it would be at that point that the Clean Energy Regulator would seek to implement the recommendations around interpretation of the method suggested by Professor Chubb.

I want to return to the resources sector. I listened carefully when you spoke earlier about not disclosing the detail of the modelling. However, I've had consultation with a number of the 215 emitters who tell me that whilst they have a program to reduce emissions over the medium turn they will not meet the targets by 2030. When they've raised this in consultation with the department, they've been told they will just have to pay the penalty. Has there been modelling done by the department that would provide information on the budgetary impact of that?

However, if people have concerns I would always be open to you making a referral, and my door is always open to stakeholders.

What I was asking, Minister, is that resources projects have advised me that they are on a pathway to emissions reduction, net zero, but that the technology that would allow them to convert from diesel to new motors won't be available to them by the 2030 time frame. One of those emitters told me that it would be a $50 million penalty that they expect the safeguard mechanism will cost them. I'm trying to understand, in the extensive consultation that has happened between the department and resource companies, if there is an understanding of the cost impact across the 215 big emitters, given that we have companies that have themselves modelled the costs that they will incur.

I do appreciate you referring to the plans that some of these businesses have in place. I think one of the things that a mature debate might recognise is that many of these businesses are thinking very carefully about their own transition to net zero.

We've had a very big debate in recent months around the nature of the government's reforms to the safeguard mechanism, where various people have expressed views about that flexibility. But, for the reasons you describe, there are limitations on the technology available this decade for some of the covered facilities. In addition to that, in some instances the necessary investment to make it a reduction may well be somewhat lumpy. It might be something that you do at a certain point in time.

I would say to you that the most important feature of the policy development around this has been a very extended engagement and consultation process with business. It has run over a very long period of time. It has been supported by a Senate inquiry process. It has been supported by public consultation and the issuing of discussion papers. We have engaged deeply to understand how these impacts might bear on individual businesses and on sectors. We've done our best to strike a balance. Many stakeholders have told us that we've done so. We're providing the certainty that business needs to make necessary investments, but also getting us on the path to meet our commitments to the international community.

Consequently, I think I'm going to have to find another way to identify that information. I have one company that has identified $50 million. If we extrapolate that across the 215, that is going to be a significant impost on those businesses. If the government doesn't know what that number is, I am concerned, because that is going to be money that would otherwise go into jobs, emissions reduction and other investments. I think the gap in the government's understanding of the impact of this tax is a gap that should be understood and appreciated by both the tax department and this department and certainly by the business community more broadly.

The sectors that you're referring to now are essentially judged to be critical to the clean energy transformation for the manufacturing sector. Retaining this capability for these hard-to-abate sectors is, in our judgement and based on the feedback we received through the consultation, essential. It was on that basis that we made adjustments to the scheme design and some of the financial arrangements, as announced by the minister earlier on.

Labor's first draft of this bill actually allowed carbon pollution to rise and unlimited dodgy offsets to flood the market. It was literally insupportable. It's clear that billion-dollar multinational fossil fuel companies, like Woodside, Santos, Adani, the Minerals Council and Chevron, write the climate policies of both major parties. Coal and gas corporations remain the puppeteers of both Labor and the coalition, and, unfortunately, as we saw from the first draft of this bill, Labor is a very willing puppet. Despite all the promises of the climate election, despite climate scientists, experts and every credible international organisation telling us we need to keep all new coal and gas in the ground as a bare minimum to save our burning planet, Labor is still refusing to deliver a national climate policy that seriously addresses the science and meets the reality of the climate emergency.

We know how important it is to take immediate action to keep every single tonne of coal and gas in the ground that we can. That's why we kept going back; that's why we kept fighting. When we look at where we've landed, what does this actually mean for those of us—the millions of Australians—who care about, voted for and demand the climate action that the science is telling us we need? It shows we've got our work cut out for us. It shows we need to break up the weird, toxic marriage between the fossil fuel industry and the Commonwealth government. We need to stop the revolving door of major party donors, who literally switch their seats in this place for seats in the boardrooms of some of the most polluting companies in the world. It's no wonder that climate politics are so cooked, when the chefs are paid and run by the fossil fuel industry.

In the face of all of those forces, in the face of decades of climate-action obstruction, and despite Labor continuing to act as the political wing of the fossil fuel industry, the Greens have secured some genuine wins that will make pollution go down in a serious way. Because coal and gas have taken a huge hit with what has been negotiated by the Greens team. I want to give credit to

That will effectively knock off around half of Labor's 116 coal and gas projects. That's a huge blow to the worst polluting projects and will make a real difference to the climate. And here's a big reason to celebrate: we have derailed the Beetaloo and Barossa gasfields. I pay tribute to those

A climate trigger has been a key demand of the environment movement for years now, and we've knocked off most of the dodgy list class of assets. Our changes could take about a quarter of future offsets out of circulation. That means companies have to commit to more actual pollution reduction, and the cost of those offsets, the cost of doing nothing, will go up. Crucially, new gasfields will have to be net zero from day one. That means opening up new gas is increasingly not viable financially.

We know that all new coal and gas needs to stay in the ground if we're going to keep this planet liveable and deliver a secure future for our kids and their kids. We have work cut out for us to break up the toxic marriage between the fossil fuel industry and the major parties in this place. The fact we had to fight Labor tooth and nail to secure these wins is more than frustrating, but it also shows what we can win. We don't win that alone here in parliament. We win that because there are millions of Australians behind us demanding this action.

We take hope from the fact that carbon pollution for the first time will be compelled to go down. We take hope from the fact that we have derailed the Beetaloo and Barossa gasfields. We can also take heart from the fact that the share price of several large coal and gas corporations took a hit straight off the back of the announcement of what the Greens have achieved. The safeguard mechanism, this bill, which regulates Australia's 215 biggest polluters, will now have a hard cap on emissions thanks to the work of the Greens, meaning real pollution must actually come down and the coal and gas corporations can't just keep paying their way out with dodgy offsets.

Every single coal and gas project that gets approved, if any do, every single one will be approved by Labor, because the only thing stopping us implementing policy that meets the science, that keeps all new coal and gas projects in the ground, the only thing that is stopping that is the lack of Labor's ambition.

We are here to continue to deliver more. We will support this bill because we know it's going to make a meaningful difference, but by no means is this the end of the struggle.

I mean, really, we have the Greens standing up in this place, talking proudly about having depressed the share price of great Australian companies like Woodside. I find it shocking that they would stand up in this place and say that. These are people who have just done a deal with the Labor government, a government that they describe as a corrupt ecocidal petrostate. This is the deal that you've done, Senator Shoebridge, and then you stand up in here and you talk about how wonderful it is that you depressed the share price of a great

It supplies gas to DomGas of Western Australia, which provides energy and heat for industrial uses right across my home state of Western Australia.

This is a great Western Australian company. It doesn't deserve to be treated with contempt by this place, by this Labor government in alliance with the Greens. Again, I can't get pass this: Senator McKim described the government they just did a deal with as a 'corrupt ecocidal petrostate'. This is the kind of alliance in government that we have between the Labor Party and the Greens. I do have some substantive questions for the minister, but I will leave it there for now.

We have alternatives for them, particularly new fossil fuel projects—there is no real argument for them. Farmers who wish to offset their own emissions, or 'inset' their emissions, are concerned about competing with fossil fuel companies for offsets, offsets that will most likely come from the land sector. We've seen farmers having to compete with fossil fuel companies for water during drought. They simply don't have the same budgets and the same access to capital. What reassurance can the government give that farmers will not suffer in the long-term as a result of the high offset prices due to huge demand from fossil fuel companies?

The situation you describe is an interesting one, isn't it, because implicit in the way that you ask the question is an acknowledgement that the land sector potentially, in a low-carbon world, is a source of real value. It offers enormous potential to store carbon, and, once a value is attached to that, that's potentially a source of value for landowners and landholders that can provide social, economic and environmental benefits to regional communities and to the landholders themselves. There are co-benefits as well. Soil carbon projects obviously have a carbon benefit, but they also improve soil health and potentially agricultural productivity. We've got lots of people operating in that way now around the country, doing interesting work and I think advocating in really interesting ways for sustainable farming.

This was something that was considered by Professor Chubb in his review, and that review recommended that the government continue to support regional communities to participate in and to benefit from the creation of

The government is working on implementing that recommendation. As a first step the government will implement a $20 million carbon farming outreach program. This program will support farmers and other land managers to access independent trusted advice to empower them to make informed decisions about whether and how to participate in carbon markets. This will ensure that farmers can make the decisions that are right for them and right for their businesses.

I identified some other transition materials—iron ore, met coal, nickel and copper—none of which are on the critical minerals list, which is surprising to many because I believe many of those should be listed, but they're not. How did you pick out cement and aluminium to be priority industries which would qualify for funding?

There were some particular issues that were identified through the course of the consultation, and they have led the government to create a separate stream of funding for the manufacturing sector, as you've described. However, for clarity, all safeguard mechanism participants will be broadly eligible to participate in the Powering the Regions Fund allocations overall, subject to other eligibility criteria. There is also the original $600 million for decarbonisation, and that is available to a broad range of safeguard participants.

The government is developing the funding allocation approach, including the delivering entity for both the $600 million fund and the $400 million fund, as part of the budget. For clarity, I can run through with you again the eligibility for both of those because I want to make sure that we are both talking about the same thing, so I would like to just run through it with you specifically. There are two streams, and I'll give them their proper names so that we can talk about the same things. The safeguard transformation stream will provide dedicated funding for projects that reduce emissions at safeguard facilities that are trade exposed. That stream will support projects that reduce emissions covered by the safeguard mechanism, specifically, and eligible facilities' scope 1 emissions. It is intended to be technology and project neutral and can support a range of project types like energy efficiency upgrades, shifts to lower-carbon processes and fuel switching. The second stream, which I think is the one you were originally asking about, is a $400 million stream of funding that's been announced for industries providing critical inputs to clean energy industries, and, as I indicated now, the program guidelines will be developed for both of these programs in the coming months.

In determining the hard cap on emissions, has there been a calculation of how long the safeguard mechanism facilities currently covered will operate for? I'm wondering if that means no new entry for hard-to-abate industries unless facilities close.

In establishing the baseline reduction requirements, the government gave consideration to expected increases in production, including the possibility of new entrants. That's not specific to particular kinds of facilities or particular kinds of activities. It's true across the board.

That is the same as the arrangements that were in place under the previous government. So, it depends on the particular nature of the operation, and I'm advised that there are a number of facilities that are covered at the moment.

Anyone who is making an investment at the moment I think already understands that they will be required, whether as a consequence of international markets or their investor community or of regulatory arrangements or some other pressure, to move to low-carbon arrangements. What the implementation of these reforms will do is give anyone who is seeking to make a decision some measure of certainty about what the government of Australia expects of them in contributing to our transformation to a low-carbon economy.

They'd be very interested to know that. In terms of lithium mining itself, some companies are being provided with a subsidy, a grant or support through other measures provided by the federal government. Certainly when we were in government we wanted to increase the mining and processing of critical minerals, such as lithium, obviously, which supports Australia's energy transition. In terms of whether they're worse off or not, if they're currently receiving the grants, the subsidies or support but they are impacted by these changes—so, they've been given this grant, subsidy or support to undertake the mining and processing of the critical minerals—is there some way to ensure that they are no worse off as a result of being impacted by the changes?

I suppose there are a range of characteristics, in scheme design, which seek to respond to the individual circumstances of particular activities. In particular, on Monday the minister indicated his intention to establish a distinct test for manufacturing entities, so as to assess whether or not they would be eligible for an adjusted baseline. To the extent that people are engaged with activity associated with manufacturing, there are some very particular arrangements. But I think your question is very general in nature.

But I'm advised that, at the moment, under arrangements established by the previous government, there is a process where the agriculture minister considers the impact where a human induced regeneration project is established in such a way as to occupy more than 30 per cent—is the benchmark—of a piece of agricultural land of a farm.

We are conscious that the development of a market for carbon and carbon sequestration presents an opportunity for landholders. You're quite right that landholders may choose to realise that in different ways, and you contemplate the possibility of sale as one of those options. I think the Chubb review gave some consideration to this, and recommended that the government continue to support individuals and communities in their engagement with that process. We're working through how to implement that. I made reference to a specific program that provides individual advice. I understand the broader question that I think you're alluding to. That is something that the government is alive to, but this bill is not a place where this is being pursued.

That has been the baseline of what farmland is worth. Here's a piece of land; how much agricultural produce can I sustainably draw from this land? We've also got a long-term process in the agricultural sector where efficiency gains and modernising and different agricultural methodologies have meant that being able to purchase your next-door neighbour has been essential to agricultural survival in the long term. I'll ask you the question, Minister: this completely changes the economic dynamics and valuation of agricultural land. By saying what you just said you're effectively agreeing with that.

I suppose part of the thing that might influence your thinking on this is that the enhanced carbon sequestration on a property is not incompatible with continuing agricultural production. In fact, there are plenty of places where that is taking place right now. It's also not the only alternative use for agricultural land. If we think about some of the pressures on agricultural land, they are widespread and diverse. It is an ongoing and general question that a country ought to be thinking about carefully. I think you're assuming that these things are mutually exclusive. In many examples they are not.

This risks taking that equation and completely wiping it out on the back of companies wishing to survive having to achieve certain obligations, not being able to do it within the timeframes required through technological means, and therefore being left with no option, if there is no technological solution, the only meaningful, viable, realistic option for them is to buy up agricultural land and lock it up. That has flow-on impact on communities right across regional Australia. It has flow-on impact on agricultural industries as agricultural industries are made smaller and their economies of scale decline and the chance of those industries folding altogether becomes much, much more realistic. This is not a hypothetical. This is happening in regional WA at the moment, where large entities are buying up agricultural land effectively to lock it up.

They ensure that Australians have well-paid jobs. But you're telling me that the government has not done a broad framework of modelling of any description to identify the cost to Australian industry and potentially the cost to Australian jobs? I want to clarify this because I think this is a very serious matter for Australia.

It was then asked of me by Senator Hughes. The nature of the analysis that's been undertaken in support of the bill has also been canvassed in Senate estimates. It was canvassed in the Senate committee that examined this legislation. I don't have anything further to the answers that I've already provided the chamber.

I think there is an exceptional flaw in the modelling of this proposal and this policy if I can tell you that this will have, at a bare minimum, hundreds of millions of dollars of impost in taxes from our most-successful and highest-tax-paying industries and employers, and the government has not done any modelling. I think this is a massive flaw in this policy, and I can only imagine the views of the government in opposition on how they would have held us to task for having failed to have done this. I appreciate that you believe you've said something to Senator Duniam and Senator Hughes, but I think that industry and people who rely on these companies will be pretty shocked to discover that there has not been specific modelling around this framework that identified a cost to Australia and Australian businesses.

In his contribution he talked about the hard cap, if I understood what he was saying, and the connection to another point that he made, which was that 58 projects were not going to proceed based on the implementation of the hard cap. I think I have what he said right, and you can correct me if you think I might be wrong. I'm wondering if you have a list of the 58 projects that might not proceed under this.

We are grateful for the Greens' willingness to negotiate, to discuss and to provide ideas about how to strengthen the policy that we took to the election. With respect to Senator Shoebridge and his colleagues, we do not accept that characterisation of the effect of the policy, so I will run through the amendment that we do in fact propose. It is that net emissions, which include offsets, by implication, must not exceed 1,233 million tonnes between '21-22 and '29-30 and that aggregate emissions must reduce over time. It does not change the elemental design feature of the proposal we put forward, which is to allow for entrants and also to allow for expansion of production of existing covered entities. With respect to colleagues, we don't consider that characterisation accurate.

Let me pause and gather my thoughts. The bill anticipates establishing a baseline for each of the covered facilities and then establishing a decline rate for them which, in the ordinary course of things, would be 4.9 per cent annually but under certain circumstances might be reduced. We canvassed these in discussions with other colleagues. The proposed decline rate includes explicit consideration of emissions from new developments consistent with the way that we treat those in our emissions projections that are already produced by government each year. New developments include new facilities, backfill projects and expansions.

What they do is establish a requirement that, on occasions when the environment minister makes an approval that will increase the emissions from a covered facility, that information is automatically transferred to the secretary of the department of climate change, to the minister and to the

That transfer of information, as you would probably understand, would occur in many instances anyway. This formalises it as a requirement on the minister for the environment. Under certain circumstances, if the Climate Change Authority or the secretary of the department considers that, on receipt of that information, we are at risk of not meeting the objects of the act, which are to reduce emissions, they must make that analysis available to the minister, who must then set in train some steps to try and remedy it. Those steps could be a change to the overall rule or they could be some other step that the minister considers necessary to achieve the objects of the act. Nothing about that alters the way that the minister for the environment would provide approvals. Nothing about that provides a capacity for the minister for climate change to stop or halt a project. I think it's important to be quite clear about that.

I have canvassed this reasonably extensively earlier in the day. The commitment we've provided over the last few days is very specific and relates very directly to the Chubb review. It relates even more specifically to recommendation 8 from Professor Chubb. That recommendation essentially makes a set of observations about how the test associated with the human-induced regeneration method ought to be applied. We have made clear that we expect that method and that interpretation to be considered in issuing any new credits to projects established under the human-induced regeneration method. We expect that the way that would happen would be in the ordinary process by which project proponents approach the Clean Energy Regulator and seek to have their credits allocated on the basis of activities undertaken under the project. I hope that makes it clear. We wouldn't characterise it in quite the same way as you've described just now.

We have been making that change over time. In 2020, the Minerals Council of Australia and its members released our first climate action plan. Since that time we have reported on an annual rolling basis our activities across the industry. It has been measured and, as I said, it has been recorded.

ACCI said, 'The business community has been very clear in its support for reforms to the Safeguard Mechanism,' and that it's the way forward for decarbonising our economy. The AiG said that of course there will be implementation questions and of course there will be detailed questions, but that this is 'essential policy infrastructure'. They say that it is time for the parliament to come to a workable agreement, which is what we're here to do, of course, this week in the parliament. Again, of course, as recently as yesterday, in taking on board all of the debates that have been happening in and around the parliament, we see that Manufacturing Australia have said that these changes are 'sensible and pragmatic'. That's what we aim to be as we get on with the job of delivering net zero by 2050 and reducing our emissions over the next several years to 2030 as well.
