       <p class="italic">

The EOI noted the ATO would consider premises to be constructed or refurbished or in existing condition.

              What we have going on here is a government that has engaged in a very, very obscure process of putting an
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
               ATO
              </a>
              building in Gosford without consulting the community, and putting it on a site that belonged to the Gosford school community. That site has long been understood by the community to be an iconic space in which the redevelopment of Gosford would happen, in particular a performing arts centre, with community participation. Instead, what we have is a dodgy deal done in darkness by this government with the state government. They have put in the Doma Group to do it—from Canberra, not from the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
               Central Coast
              </a>
              —and they are going to pay them $70 million over the next 10 years in rent. This is a shameful use of taxpayers dollars, against the will of the community. I call on the government to halt this process and consult the community before they waste that money. They need to put the ATO in the middle of Gosford not on that site.
