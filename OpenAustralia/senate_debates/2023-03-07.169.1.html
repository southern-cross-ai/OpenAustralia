       <p class="italic">
        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 28 October 2020, the then Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        , referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (the PJCIS) a general inquiry to report on national security risks affecting the higher education and research sector (the sector).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 25 March 2022, the Committee delivered its final report, 'National security risks affecting the Australian higher education and research sector' (the Report) which made 27 recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Report" rel="nofollow">
         The Report
        </a>
        considered the broad national security risks present in the sector, with a particular focus on the prevalence, characteristics and significance of foreign interference, undisclosed foreign interference, data theft and espionage and associated risks to Australia's national security in the sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        welcomes and broadly supports the majority of the recommendations. It also welcomes the acknowledgement throughout the report of the substantial work undertaken or underway by the sector and the Commonwealth agencies through the University Foreign Interference Taskforce (UFIT) and other key lines of effort in order to raise awareness and increase resilience to foreign interference.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will continue to support and collaborate with universities in policy development, capability building, guidelines implementation, information sharing and an overall positive partnership to deepen universities ' resilience against foreign interference
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendations
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        recommends the Australian higher education and research sector, via the University Foreign Interference Taskforce, undertake a campaign of active transparency in relation to the national security risks. The Committee recommends that the University Foreign Interference Taskforce have oversight of this campaign and report to the Australian Government on progress.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Supported
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The University Foreign Interference Taskforce will continue its efforts to build the sector's understanding of the risk and context of foreign interference and appropriate responses. The University Foreign Interference Taskforce will continue to update Ministers on the sector' s progress in implementing the UFIT Guidelines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reco mmendation 2: The Committee welcomes the revised UFIT Guidelines and further recommends adherence to those guidelines be reported annually to the PJCIS in writing, accompanied by a classified briefing. This briefing should include an explanation of the cap abilities developed to monitor and evaluate compliance with the guidelines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government should further consider the UFIT terms of reference and update relevant guidance material to ensure the body remains fit for purpose.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Supported in Principle
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is working with the sector to define reporting arrangements on the implementation of the revised UFIT Guidelines and will share with the PJCIS the findings of any report. Agencies will be available to provide a classified briefing to the PJCIS. The University Foreign Interference Taskforce will keep its terms of reference under review and update, on a regular basis, guidance material as appropriate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3: The Committee recommends University Foreign Interference Taskforce assist universities to introduce, maintain and develop relevant training on national security issues for staff and students. Universities should employ an accountable authority who is responsible for managing foreign interference risks at their institution. This position should be based upon the framework set out in part 1.2 of the updated UFIT Guidelines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Supported
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The University Foreign Interference Taskforce has established a Training Working Group to complement the sector's existing work in order to ensure the availability of appropriate training materials for staff and students to counter foreign interference.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Officials from Home Affairs and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        will continue a program of outreach activities with the sector to support implementation of the UFIT Guidelines. The UFIT Guidelines encourage universities to have accountable authorities responsible for managing foreign interference risk.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4: The Committee recommends the University Foreign Interference Taskforce establish a working group to address the issue of on-campus intimidation, reporting on fellow students or staff to foreign embassies, and intimidati on on campuses related to the national security risks and make recommendations to the Australian Government and the sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This group, as a matter of urgency, should provide clear guidance to universities on implementing penalties for foreign interference activities on campus, including reporting on fellow students to foreign governments. These should be clearly defined in university codes of conduct and communicated to students.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Supported
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The UFIT Guidelines encourage universities to have communication plans and education programs that raise awareness and support mitigation of their foreign interference risks, including instances of intimidation and harassment (UFIT Guideline 2.1). The University Foreign Interference Taskforce Training Working Group will consider behavioural issues on campus as part of its remit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5: The Committee recommends the Department of Education, Skills and Training should, in concert with the University Foreign Interference Taskforce, annually publish a repor t that documents incidents of harassment, intimidation and censorship that occur as a result of foreign interference activities on Australian university campuses. This report should include the steps and responses, if any, taken by the university.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response : Noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If clandestine, it can be difficult to establish foreign interference as the motivating factor for harassment, intimidation and censorship. The Government is working with the sector to define reporting arrangements on the implementation of the revised UFIT Guidelines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 6: The Committee recommends the Department of Education, Skills and Training and the Department of Home Affairs work to develop a secure mechanism that allows individual students to anonymously report incidents of intimi dation, retaliation, harassment, or censorship on campus where a student believes those behaviours are associated with foreign interference.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Supported
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Individual students are able to anonymously report instances of foreign interference on campus through the National Security Hotline. Through ongoing outreach efforts, Home Affairs and ASIO will continue to promote the National Security Hotline and NITRO (Notifiable Incidents, Threats and Reportable Observations) as reporting mechanisms for suspected instances of foreign interference.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 7: The Committee recommends that Universities who elect to host a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius_Institute" rel="nofollow">
         Confucius Institute
        </a>
        should disclose and make public details of those agreements and funding arrangements, and that at a minimum, Universities have a final say about the appointment of staff, curriculum content and that robust academic freedom and free speech clauses be included in any agreement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee supports the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Foreign Minister
        </a>
        using her existing veto powers under the For eign Relations Act to make determinations in the national interest, including in relation to Confucius Institutes.

       <p class="italic">
        Response: Noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In accordance with the UFIT Guidelines, universities will continue to apply a comprehensive approach to their due diligence in assessing foreign interference risks and reflect that in the terms of any agreement to host a Confucius Institute.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Arrangements between Australian public universities and Chinese government entities and/or universities relating to Confucius Institutes are required to be notified to the Minister for Foreign Affairs under the Australia 's

         DFAT

        ) reviews Confucius Institute arrangements notified under the Act in consultation with Government agencies and provides advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister may exercise powers with respect to individual foreign arrangements within scope of the Act where the arrangement is, or is likely to be, inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy or adverse to Australia's foreign relations. Separate from their powers under the Act, the Minister may also direct DFAT to pursue mitigations to manage foreign policy risks, where identified.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        DFAT, in consultation with other agencies, has assessed all Confucius Institute arrangements notified and within scope of the Act. The Government's resilience measures, including UFIT and the Foreign Arrangements Scheme (as established by the Act), are an effective mechanism for engaging with the university sector to ensure universities are informed about and are managing risk associated with foreign engagement, including with respect to Confucius Institutes. DFAT will keep these arrangements under review. DFAT is actively engaging with universities directly and through UFIT to convey the Government's expectations, and advice on negotiating arrangements that protect Australia' s interests and mitigate risks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 8: The Committee recommends the Foreign Minister exercise her power under the Foreign Relations Act to make a determination in the national interest relating to the agreement between

       <p class="italic">
        Monash University has advised that all currently active research projects between Monash and COMAC will conclude in the first half of 2023, and no further activity is planned. Government agencies will maintain regular contact with Monash University and keep this cooperation under review.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 9: The Committee recommends the higher education sector take note of the "Blueprint for Critical Technolo gies" released by the Critical Technologies Policy Coordination Office within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
        </a>
        on 17 November 2021 as a reference for areas of research sensitive to the national interest and exercise greater caution with interna tional research partnerships, PhD students and cyber-security. However, the Committee urges the sector not to consider this list exhaustive and to also use their own judgement about technologies which might subsequently emerge. In these sensitive research cases, universities should be required to provide additional security assurances regarding research personnel to Commonwealth funding agencies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Supported
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The University Foreign Interference Taskforce has established a Critical Technology Working Group to identify critical technologies that require heightened due diligence when considering international research partnerships, PhD students and cyber-security.

        Recommendation 10: The Committee recommends ASIO, in their annual report to parliament, provide information on threats to the Australian higher education and research sector as a routine part of their broader threat assessment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Not supported
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ASIO does not consider it appropriate to highlight a single sector in its Annual Report when multiple sectors are being targeted by our adversaries. It could be misleading and, in some circumstances, give Australia's adversaries actionable information about ASIO investigations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is also important to note that ASIO uses multiple mechanisms for providing threat information. Apart from the Annual Report, the Director-General delivers an Annual Threat Assessment and appears before Senate Committees. ASIO regularly briefs the higher education sector on the security environment, and also prepares and disseminates outreach reports on threats to specific sectors, including higher education. It would be preferable for ASIO to have maximum flexibility in how it delivers information about threats to higher education, tailored to the specific circumstances at the time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 11: The Committee recommends the University Foreign Interference Taskforce establish clear policies on what constitutes acceptable dual appointments of foreign diplomats at Australian tertiary institutions. Universities should also make their own judgements about whether a ppointments are consistent with the values they seek to uphold.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Additionally, the Committee recommends the Attorney-General's Department and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade consider whether appointments of foreign diplomats to Australian tertiary i nstitutions are adequately addressed via existing legislative frameworks.

        Australian export control legislation requires each export application to be assessed against twelve legislative criteria broadly addressing foreign policy, human rights, national security, regional security and international obligations. The Department of Defence continues to monitor processing times and implement process improvements to reduce those processing times as far as possible. Certain export applications require specialist advice from other government departments and agencies, which can extend processing times.
