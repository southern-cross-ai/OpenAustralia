        These are amendments that the chamber has seen a number of times. What they seek to do is undo the censoring of our parliament, or the restraint on our own parliament, from conducting oversight of intelligence operations and associated information gathering. These are important amendments that basically seek to provide a check and balance against the powers that are being proposed by the government. As I said, in principle I support what the government is doing. I do share some of Senator Roberts's concerns. These sorts of concerns could be addressed if the PJCIS were able to examine those operations. There is a safety mechanism in these amendments to make sure that, if there is something that is extremely sensitive going on, the PJCIS could be prevented from looking into the operation until after it has commenced, so it has appropriate safeguards. These are good amendments. They are oversight amendments. This is something that Labor indicated on several occasions it will support, but it has failed to do so. I commend the amendments to the committee.

         The government does not support the amendments moved by Senator Patrick. The government's view is that the remit of the

         should not be expanded to include oversight of agencies' operational activities. We consider it remains appropriate for ministers to primarily oversee operations and be accountable to the parliament.

         -General of Intelligence and Security already has extensive powers to oversee and inquire into the legality and propriety of National Intelligence Community operations, publishes an unclassified version of reports and appears before the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on non-operational matters. We consider that existing arrangements appropriately balance accountability with the need to protect sensitive operations and capabilities and that further oversight by the committee is not necessary.

          I rise to indicate that the Greens will be supporting Senator Patrick's amendments as circulated and to raise similar concerns to Senator Patrick's in relation to the rushing of this particular piece of legislation. I want to let you know there is another amendment being circulated, in the name of Senator Thorpe, which we will also need to deal with today.

             I just want to acknowledge that Senator Patrick, who I am sure has the best of intentions, moves this amendment at every national security bill. Every time he moves it, we make clear once again our view that it is not an appropriate mechanism by which to deal with his question. I note again, for the record, that Senator McAllister has a private senator's bill before the parliament that deals with these very questions. Labor would prefer to take a holistic and systemic approach to this question and not deal with it in a piecemeal fashion as we see that Senator Patrick's amendment does. In the interests of time, and my desire to see this bill pass this chamber this week, I just wanted to put on the record our view on this amendment.

              [by video link] I will respond to Senator Keneally. I note it looks like she might have run from her office to get there, and I appreciate her doing that to make some comments. It is a ruse to suggest that you won't vote on an amendment to a government bill that basically includes the provisions of a private member's bill. We need to understand that a private member's bill might get voted on in the Senate, go to the House and never be seen again. The only way to give effect to change is to put amendments to government bills that the government has to deal with in the House. Senator Keneally knows that, and so it's a bit disingenuous to suggest that this is an inappropriate way to do it—that a private member's bill is a much better way.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm disappointed that Labor is again voting on an amendment that gives effect to its own policies. I invite Senator Keneally—if you don't quite like what my amendment does—to have the Labor Party introduce a similar amendment the next time a security bill goes through the parliament. I put that on the record, and we'll see next time around how serious the Labor Party really is. We do have these sorts of bills going through on a semiregular basis, which is part of the problem: more and more powers get made without the right checks and balances. There's an opportunity here. I put the challenge to Senator Keneally, and we'll talk about this the next time an intelligence bill goes through the chamber. You are simply so weak on giving effect to change as bills go through this place. You simply stand up and talk, but you never actually do anything. That's a significant problem, and Labor ought to reflect on this. They're not serving the public well. They are, in effect, dudding their own policy. There's a way in which these things can be done and, sadly, you're not up to the task.

              <p>
               Minister, I'm not sure if people out there know this, but there are people who work in your parliamentary office who can walk out with whatever they want when they leave as staff—and that would include files and personal files—and then use that material against you on social platforms. Would this be able to fix that issue, without any charges or anything being laid? Will this fix any of that?

                Senator Lambie, I couldn't quite properly hear what you were saying. I'll take you through what the purpose of the bill is, and that may well answer the question that you have posed. This is all about, as I said, part of the government's response to the challenges posed by anonymising technologies and cyber-enabled crime such as offending perpetrated on the dark web. I'll briefly summarise what the bill does, in three parts. It enhances the ability of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
                 AFP
                </a>
                and the ACIC to identify and disrupt. It's all about serious crime online. In that regard, data disruption warrants authorise the deletion or modification of data—the examples that I previously gave were things such as child exploitation material—to frustrate the commission of serious offences online. Network activity warrants enable the AFP and the ACIC to collect intelligence on criminal networks operating online. Account takeover warrants allow law enforcement to take control of online accounts in order to gather evidence about a person's online criminality and the activity of their associates. This bill is very much in relation to the challenges posed by anonymising technologies and cyber-enabled crime. The most obvious example that people understand is offending perpetrated on the dark web.

                  I am just getting for you the list of serious offences. I'm sure the advisers are looking for me, to ensure that I do have them. In particular, I will look at exactly what we're looking at targeting. As you'd know, the 'dark web' refers to areas of the internet which are intentionally hidden and cannot be accessed without using specialised browsers. I think you'd also know that, because of the nature of the dark web, this area of the internet is not indexed by ordinary search engines. 'Anonymising technology' refers to technology which can be used to disguise a person's activity, location and true identity. The types of 'serious crimes' include child abuse and exploitation, terrorism, and the sale of illicit drugs and weapons. We're referring to that there. Warrants can only be sought in relation to what is called a relevant offence. This is a federal offence or a state offence that has a federal aspect punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of three years or more. That criterion is consistent with existing thresholds for warrant powers as set out in the Surveillance Devices Act 2004.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I have some further information for you: amendments have been made to the issuing criteria for warrants to ensure that, when considering whether to issue a warrant, issuing authorities give extra weight to the most serious types of cyber-enabled crime, which is what you were referring to. This reflects the purposes of the bill and the PJCIS's intent to focus the use of these powers—and I go back to the original answer that I was giving to you—on the most serious crimes perpetrated on the dark web and through the use of anonymising technologies. Again, as I've referred to previously, this includes child exploitation, terrorism, cybercrime, money laundering and drugs and firearm trafficking.

                   [by video link] As to that list of serious offences, who decides what's going to be a serious offence? Is that taken off someone else's blueprint somewhere, or was that just decided within the committee itself? Obviously, if you're going to go through a court, it's got to come under one of those serious offences, whatever you've dictated the serious offences would be. Who lists those serious offences?

                           [by video link] Minister, this bill rejects a core recommendation of the Richardson review: that law enforcement agencies should not be given specific cyberdisruption powers such as would apply under the proposed data disruption warrant regime. Why are you rejecting this specific conclusion of the Richardson review?

Any technical assistance provided by the ASD in support of the new powers would be consistent with the ASD's existing statutory powers to assist Commonwealth agencies. The bill is consistent with recommendation 162 of the Richardson review to the extent that the review recommended that the

However, the bill recognises that the ACIC, drawing on its specialist criminal intelligence capabilities, also plays a vital role in discovering serious and organised criminal activity.

                                    I can advise that a data disruption warrant cannot authorise causing any material loss or damage to data unless the issuing authority considers it reasonably necessary and proportionate to the offences targeted. For example, reasonably necessary and proportionate loss or damage may involve a loss incurred as a result of taking action against a large group of individuals committing a particularly serious offence. Whether the disruption of data is reasonably necessary and proportionate will be determined by the issuing authority on a case-by-case basis. There may be circumstances in which it would be reasonably necessary and proportionate to cause loss or damage to the data of third parties. For example, it may be reasonably necessary and proportionate for an agency to shut down an online site hosting the live streaming of child exploitation material. I'll just say that again: for example, it may be reasonably necessary and proportionate for an agency to shut down an online site hosting the live streaming of child exploitation material, despite the owner or administrator of that site not necessarily being suspected of this type of criminality. However, it may not be reasonably necessary and proportionate if an agency were to delete all of the data on a third-party computer that was used to access a dark-web forum advertising illicit drugs.

                                    I can also advise a person's account may only be taken over when taking control of that account is likely to substantially assist in enabling the collection of evidence relating to serious criminal offences. An account takeover warrant cannot authorise material interfering with a person's lawful use of a computer unless absolutely necessary to facilitate the collection of evidence, and account takeover warrant cannot under any circumstances authorise causing material loss or damage to any person lawfully using a computer. An account takeover warrant cannot be executed in a manner that causes a person the loss of money, digital currency or property other than data. When considering whether to issue an account takeover warrant, the magistrate must take into account the extent to which the privacy of any person is likely to be affected. Also, I can advise that the Commonwealth Ombudsman will provide robust oversight of the use of the account takeover power by the

                                        What I will advise you, Senator Patrick, is that network activity warrants and data disruption warrants can be issued by an eligible judge or a nominated

                                        member. As I've previously advised in answers to other questions, this is consistent with who can issue the existing warrants under the Surveillance Devices Act 2004, such as computer access warrants. It is anticipated that these warrants will be used to complement other powers available to agencies. Account takeover warrants can be issued by a magistrate, as this is consistent with other powers, such as search powers in the

                                        I am just looking at whether or not I can provide you with further information. I can also advise in relation to recommendation 9 of the PJCIS report—and this may be what you were alluding to—that removing the ability for AAT members to issue warrants would have a significant impact on Australia's current electronic surveillance framework and would be a departure from longstanding government policy. The inability to obtain AAT approval would likely result in operational delays in obtaining these warrants. For example, the

                                        currently experiences delays obtaining warrants from state and territory magistrates. I am informed that there can actually be up to a three-day wait in some jurisdictions. Given these potentially wide-ranging implications and the desire for consistency—and I do stress that, Senator Patrick—across other warrant powers, the government will consider this issue further as part of the holistic review of Australia's electronic surveillance framework, which is currently underway. I can also advise that a 'nominated AAT member is a person who is either the deputy president, senior member or member of the AAT' who has been nominated by the Attorney-General to issue warrants under the Surveillance Devices Act.

                                           s, for example. When you start getting down to senior members and members, they can be all sorts of appointees—I know you'll understand this; I'm not trying to be political here—including appointees of both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party under the provisions of the

                                           Act that allow a person to be appointed if they have a particular experience that is needed by the AAT. That means that we have seen the appointment—to be fair, both Liberal Party and Labor Party appointees—of former staffers, advisers and so forth. My concern is that this is a power that would normally—you'd normally want someone who has a strong legal background so as to ensure that there is not any abuse. You might recall that during the media raids we had difficulties with warrants being issued and there was a subsequent High Court matter. I just want to understand whether or not, because it is one of the requirements in the AAT Act for one class of member to have a law degree, anyone is likely to be nominated to carry out these particular functions if they don't have suitable legal qualifications.
