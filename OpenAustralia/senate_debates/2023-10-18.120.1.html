        , Senator Farrell. Following the Jobs and Skills Summit last year, the Albanese government announced several measures in the social services portfolio to reduce barriers to employment and support inclusion. This includes a temporary work bonus measure. Can the minister please outline any action the government has taken to build on this temporary measure?

          No, that was yesterday! At last year's Jobs and Skills Summit, promoting social inclusion and reducing barriers to work was a key feature of the government's agenda. This was demonstrated through our government's decision to temporarily boost the pension work bonus, allowing more aged pensioners and veterans to earn and work more before their pension is reduced.
         </p>
         <p>
          I know you don't like these provisions, Senator Smith; I know you don't like them. But we're doing it.
         </p>
         <p>
          The employment white paper handed down in September, developed following the Jobs and Skills Summit, laid out a road map for permanent steps the government could take to continue this important work. Today my very good friend the Minister for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
           Social Services
          </a>
          , who's doing a terrific job, introduced legislation to the House that will, from 1 January 2024, provide all new entrants over age pension age and eligible veterans with a $4,000 work bonus income bank starting balance and will permanently retain the maximum income bank balance cap of $11,800 for all pensioners. These changes will mean that eligible pensioners can choose to take up more work if they choose to do so without their pensions being impacted.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government's initiative has been welcomed by stakeholders who represent older Australians, including the Council on the Ageing

             I thank Senator Polley for her first supplementary question. We are delivering on our government's commitment to double the income nil rate period to 24 weeks and extend access to those entering full-time work. This means that Australians on income support who re-enter the workforce will be able to stay in the system longer and keep other benefits like the concession card, the childcare subsidies and the supplementary payments. These changes will reduce the need to reapply for income support if a new job doesn't work out, particularly short-term and casual work. These changes will support more Australians to take up employment opportunities if they wish to do so, but only if they wish to do so.

                I thank Senator Polley for her second supplementary question. The measures introduced today will complement the other vital work our government is doing to support Australians on income support. This includes additional cost-of-living relief going to income support recipients who are doing it tough, including increases to Commonwealth rent assistance and the expansion of eligibility for parenting payments for singles.
               </p>
               <p>
                Since 20 September, these measures have put more money into the pockets of Australians doing it the toughest. This is on top of vital cost-of-living relief through the energy bill relief, cheaper medicines and, of course, the tripling of the Medicare bulk-billing incentive. Labor is committed to standing up for Australians—
