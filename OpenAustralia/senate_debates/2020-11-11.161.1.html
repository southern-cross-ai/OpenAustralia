           On 19 October 2020 the Minister for Defence made a public interest immunity claim in response to general business notice of motion No. 786. The claim was made on the grounds that provision of the requested document would harm the Commonwealth's ability to achieve value for money, negotiate
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC" rel="nofollow">
            ARC

           arrangements and meet Australia's broader strategic objectives. Commercial-in-confidence and national interest issues are the grounds for public interest immunity and have been recognised by successive governments. The government affirms the public interest immunity claim made by the minister.

              It's the usual story: the Senate is being denied access to information necessary to conduct its oversight function. How do I know this? Well, one of the documents to which the order applies is one that I have

              'd. It's one which the department originally said did not exist. They were then forced to admit that it did. I went through a process to get access to it—it was a lengthy process—and eventually the

                 Senator Patrick, I will do it because you haven't asked before. I can insist on the bells being rung for one minute upon repeated divisions. I've said it numerous times today. I'll reset them now for four minutes, because I didn't consult with you previously. But when I ask senators to remain in the chamber—
