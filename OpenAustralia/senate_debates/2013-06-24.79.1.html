         I thank Senator Gallacher for his question and his well-known interest in the Australian and particularly the

         tourism industry. The Gillard government supports tourism across Australia, including in our regions, through a range of targeted grants programs and initiatives and through our highly effective marketing tool,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Tourism Australia
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         In the 2012 round of our T-QUAL Grants Program, nearly 90 per cent of successful applications were from outside Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, with a very high proportion being from regional areas. There were 294 applications received for the current T-QUAL round, which closed on 3 May. Successful applicants will be announced later this year and we expect many regional projects to again earn a grant. Direct support for our regional tourism sector is provided through our $48.5 million Tourism Industry Regional Development Fund grants program, known as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIRF" rel="nofollow">
          TIRF
         </a>
         . Successful applicants under the first round of TIRF were announced in March. In that round we initially offered a total of $13.5 million, Senator Ronaldson, to 65 successful applicants, leveraging a total of $141 million investment in regional tourism across Australia. An additional 19 high-quality projects will share in a total of $4.3 million funding under the round 1 projects.
        </p>
        <p>
         Round 2 of TIRF opens today. I was very pleased to be able to announce the second round on Saturday at the Seppeltsfield Estate Winery in South Australia's iconic
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barossa_Valley" rel="nofollow">
          Barossa Valley
         </a>
         . Seppeltsfield has been offered $250,000 under round 1 of our TIRF program. The winery owners believe the projects, with the support of TIRF, will boost their visitor numbers by 30 per cent.

            program opens today and closes on 7 August. The second round is making nearly $10 million available for projects that will boost regional tourism. Many of the successful projects will be bricks-and-mortar initiatives that will improve the quality of existing tourism destinations, products and services. Others will be new and innovative tourism developments.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have also included a specific labour and skills funding stream in this round, called Labour and Skills Enhance. This stream makes more than $2 million available for projects that improve regional Australia's capacity to increase tourism labour supply and lift service quality. This funding will support labour and skills related infrastructure such as training centres or staff accommodation. It is also available for a broad range of projects that deliver targeted, practical measures to address labour and skills needs such as the training programs and regional tourism.

                I thank Senator Gallacher for his excellent supplementary question. Forty five cents in every dollar spent on tourism in Australia is spent in regional destinations. There were nearly two million international visitors to regional Australia in the year 2012 and collectively they spent about $3 billion. Domestically, there were 47 million visitors to regional Australia and they spent more than $23 billion.
               </p>
               <p>
                Clearly, tourism is an integral part of the local economy for many regional areas. The labour statistics suggest that tourism's contribution to regional economies is growing. International tourists are increasingly looking for uniquely Australian experiences, many of which are in our regions. Australian holidaymakers are visiting our regions more often and spending more time and more money in those areas, which is supporting local jobs and regional economies, even in
