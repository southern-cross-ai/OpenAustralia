        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Water, Minister Ruston. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" rel="nofollow">
         International Energy Agency
        </a>
        said that we cannot open up even one more new coal, oil or gas project if we're to meet net zero by 2050. Under the National Gas Infrastructure Plan announced last week, the Morrison government wants to open up three massive new gas basins and up to 11 gas pipelines. This plan for massive gas expansion locks in the devastating global heating and pushes 1.5 degrees beyond reach. Minister, you can't implement the National Gas Infrastructure Plan and meet net zero by 2050. Which one do you choose?

         I thank Senator Cox for her question. Senator Cox, I have to disagree with your assessment of the ability to deliver the National Gas Infrastructure Plan at the same time as meeting the targets that we committed to internationally, to make sure that we achieve net zero by 2050. The absolute express answer and explicit answer to your question is: I do believe that both are achievable simultaneously. What I can also add to that is that this government absolutely remains committed to meeting all of its commitments, all of its targets and all of its promises to Australia. That includes making sure that we deliver affordable and reliable energy to support the economy so that the economy supports jobs and so that jobs are available for Australians, so that they can have the opportunity to be able to access the opportunities that are presented by our resource sector going into the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are also absolutely committed to meeting our targets. Our track record so far, as a government, in terms of meeting targets that have previously been agreed to is exceptional. We meet our targets and we exceed our targets. There is every possibility that we will continue to do that. We are intending to exceed our targets as we go through to 2030. We, as a government, are absolutely committed to the delivery of the National Gas Infrastructure Plan, because it is absolutely imperative to rural and regional Australia—the jobs, the businesses and economies of people who live outside of the capital cities. I know that most of you live in capital cities, but this is a program that not only supports all Australians, allows Australians to be able to benefit from the wealth of the resources that sit under our ground, but supports our regional communities, their economies and the jobs for people that live in regional Australia. I would have thought that that is what you would have wanted too.

            What this government will continue to do is to provide the appropriate protections to all Australians businesses that are afforded through the extraordinary amount of regulation that's put in place to make sure that we not only have a balanced response but we also protect the future of this country. The resource sector provides Australia with an amazing opportunity for our growth and our wealth. A responsible way of extracting those resources to the benefit of all Australians is what this government will do. We have in place extraordinary regulation and extraordinary regulators to make sure that it's done in a way that is appropriate, that doesn't damage our environment, but at the same time provides the economic development that Australia and all Australians deserve to be able to benefit from, which is our amazing resources sector. Rural and regional Australia has lived off the sheep's back and out of the resources that come out of the ground for many years and it will continue to.

               I think that the statement that Senator Cox just made is completely inaccurate and I completely refute it. I don't believe that everybody believes the statement that you've just put forward to the chamber. In fact, I think that most reasonable Australians actually understand that good governments can balance out making sure that we look after our environment but at the same time make sure that our economy is strong, because a strong economy supports all Australians, and that includes people who live in rural and regional Australia as well as those who live in the cities. We know that our gas-fired recovery is extremely important for Australia. We will do it in a responsible way that doesn't damage the environment. We will not do it in a way that damages Australian businesses, puts jobs on the line and—
