        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Reynolds. Can the minister update the Senate on the devastating situation occurring in Perth right now, with the Wooroloo bushfire that's burning out of control in Perth's eastern suburbs?

         I thank Senator O'Sullivan for the question. A bushfire is burning at the emergency warning level in the shires of Mundaring, Chittering and Northam and the City of Swan, 27 kilometres north-east of Perth. It is an area I know well and love, as I know all
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia

         n senators do. The bushfire remains uncontained and out of control. The

          Emergency Services
         </a>
         has confirmed that at least 71 properties have been destroyed and the bushfire has so far burned over 9,000 hectares. I'm advised that no lives have been lost and no-one is yet unaccounted for. However, there remains the potential for wind changes, maintaining very unfavourable conditions. We urge everyone to stay aware of their surroundings and follow the advice from local emergency management authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
         While weather conditions have been hampering firefighting efforts, our emergency services personnel are once again showing their professionalism, their dedication and their heroism in the face of these extreme conditions. On behalf of Minister Littleproud, on behalf of the federal government and I know on behalf of all senators in this place I thank everyone who is contributing and working so hard in the firefighting effort to protect these communities and to ensure that there is no loss of life. Our thoughts and our prayers are with the people of Western Australia and with all of our emergency services, and, most importantly and most sincerely, with all of those impacted by these horrific fires.

He's also activating Australian government disaster payments for those most affected in the Mundaring and Swan local government areas. Today, defence is supporting water-bombing operations from

              government is fighting not only a COVID-19 outbreak in Western Australia but also these fires. Yesterday, defence accepted a request for additional assistance to the WA government's COVID-19 response. This support is in addition to the 1,500 ADF personnel still deployed across the country supporting COVID-19 actions in all states and territories. This includes 150 who are currently working in Western Australia, so 50 additional staff will be based in Perth supporting the

              region. Vehicle checkpoints are police led, with ADF providing marshalling and initial assessment of vehicles. This takes the total number of ADF members on task in Western Australia to 200, which includes 93 personnel who are still supporting quarantine compliance measures in seven hotels—

                  Obviously we concur with the thanks to the emergency service workers. Like Senator Reynolds, I have many friends who live in the area. It's an area of Perth where you have acreage that meets the outer suburban areas. In fact, a former staff member of mine, Rhys, was evacuated two nights ago at 2 am.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I want to acknowledge the huge kindness and generosity of the Perth community. There are all sorts of offers of help, as you can imagine. Being an area of acreage, there are prized horses and other livestock, which people all over the metro area are offering to agist. There are free meals being delivered. Just as we saw the Sikh community in the eastern states respond to the fire emergency, the Sikh community in Bennett Springs, a suburb that's likely to be threatened, are also out there working. That generosity, I'm sure, makes all of us as

                   n member in the other place has friends and family that live in the hills area and the fire affected area, as do senators. I myself certainly do.

                   are very thankful for the response from the federal government. We wish well all the emergency personnel and those people that are currently fighting the fire and defending people's homes and lives. Our hearts go out to everyone that is affected by this current disaster, given the particular circumstances that Western Australia and the Perth metropolitan area are facing at the moment with the double impact of the COVID lockdown. It is a very stressful time at home in Western Australia, and I thank the government for the response that they are making.
