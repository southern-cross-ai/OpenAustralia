         The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN: You are.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thank you. I outlined in my earlier statement a little detail around why the Greens are bringing these amendments.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to now ask some questions about the amendments themselves. To quickly rehash, there are six amendments. Amendments (1) to (4) are fairly straightforward. They relate both to labour market testing and licensing requirements. Amendment (5) relates to labour market testing, and amendment (6) relates specifically to licensing requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
         Minister, in relation directly to subclass 400 visa holders, which includes installers and services, I mentioned some of the stakeholders who had concerns that the current deal between Labor and the Liberals relating to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFA" rel="nofollow">
          IFA
         </a>
         s does not cover the employment of Chinese workers who are employed by standard 457 visa sponsors, or direct employers, who are not part of an IFA, and that under the terms of CHAFTA these workers would not be subject to labour market testing. Can the minister confirm if labour market testing is required for this subclass and class of visas?

           Yes, particularly subclass 400 visa holders, but if you could also make comments around contractual service providers entering into the subclass 457 visa holders, as well. The question is basically this: can you confirm that no labour market testing is required for those two categories?

            I am advised that it is not required if it is in contravention of our international obligations in relation to subclass 400 temporary-work, short-stay activity visas. A clarification: in relation to the 400 visa, no labour market testing is required. The very nature of a 400 visa is that it is a very short term visa for a very specific purpose. The government does not believe that there is any necessity for labour market testing in this particular space. In relation to 457 visas, my previous answer stands—that is, not if it is in contravention of our international obligations.

             In relation to the 400 visa holders, could the minister confirm, specifically in relation to the short-stay visas, whether there is a cap or a limit on the number of visas that can be issued?

              I am advised that there is not any cap. However, there is no evidence to suggest that there is any reason for an acceleration in this particular visa. My understanding is that the medium-stay period for a 400 visa is just 20 days.

                   I have a few questions relating to licensing requirements. I will get to those in a second. In relation to labour market testing, does the minister accept some of the criticisms that the committees—both JSCOT and the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee—received around the concerns that the removal of the requirement for labour market testing in these categories means that Australian workers could lose employment opportunities to temporary migrants?

                     For example, in their submission to the Foreign Affairs, Defence And Trade Committee, the Electrical Trade Union said that the removal of the labour market testing provisions for issuing 457 visas to Chinese workers sets the stage for Australian workers to be robbed of opportunities and undercut by a new class of immigrant working poor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We also had several submitters arguing that there are existing problems with a lack of enforcement of standards for 457 visa workers, and we heard examples of temporary migrant workers being employed in unfair and unsafe conditions. Could the minister address the enforcement provisions currently in place to prevent this from happening?

                      On the same subject, I wondered if the minister could also indicate to me if these rules, particularly for 457 visas, have been consistent for a number of years. I am not sure if the minister will be able to answer this, but was there labour market testing for the celebrated case of a 457 visa applicant who ended up working in the office of a Prime Minister a few years ago. I am wondering what the market testing arrangements were back then and whether they are the same now under the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement? I am curious to understand the correlation between the testing that was required some years ago, which I am sure the Greens political party would have, as well, raised as issues at the time. I am curious—but I am not sure if the minister will be able to give me information from back in the time of another government—as to what labour market testing there was. Are we led to believe that there was not another single person in the whole of Australia who could run the Prime Minister's office at the time? That is one part of my question to the minister.

                         I apologise to Senator Whish-Wilson. It was germane to his question, and I thought that, when the minister was answering Senator Whish-Wilson's question, she might be able, as part of that, to answer my questions as well. The other thing that the minister may or may not be able to assist with is whether the visa arrangements under the China free trade agreement are similar to those in the free trade agreements that were entered into during the period from 2007 to 2013—that is, the time of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. I do not think that there were many free trade agreements, but I have a suspicion that one of the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_American" rel="nofollow">
                          South American
                         </a>
                         countries entered into one at that time—perhaps it was the Mexican free trade agreement. I am wondering, for the sake of comparison, whether the arrangements under the China free trade agreement are similar to those that applied in other cases or whether there has been a change.

                          In the first instance, as was rightly pointed out by Senator Macdonald, anybody who employs somebody on one of these visas is required to demonstrate that there is no Australian capable of undertaking that job. In relation to comments about the previous Prime Minister's office and how they dealt with the issue of the 457 visa, I have absolutely no idea. It is something that you may need to find out elsewhere. I am not privy to the information in relation to the employment of the person who was in the previous Prime Minister's office on a 457 visa. In relation to anybody who is in breach of their obligations in the employment of somebody on one of these visas, there are very clear sanctions. They will be issued against any business that breaches their obligations in relation to the employment of people on these types of visas.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          In answer to your question, Senator Macdonald, about any free trade arrangements that were signed between 2007 and 2013, my understanding is that the only agreement that was signed during that time was with Chile and that the conditions that related to labour market testing were largely the same as the conditions that have been contained in the recent free trade agreements that have been signed with a number of our close Asian partners and neighbours.

                             A word that rhymes with 'reported' is 'rorted'. I wanted to know if you have any data or whether you could answer the criticisms that we received during the Senate inquiry. Do you know how often these things are audited in the first place, and what results have you from the presumably limited audits?

                              I can advise that there have been an increased number of resources made available to the Fair Work Commission to operate in this space. My understanding is that somewhere between three and five per cent of businesses in this area are audited at some stage by Fair Work Australia and that there is a very, very low incidence of inappropriate or illegal activity occurring in this space.

                               I would have thought that three per cent of a growing pool of these visas is a very low number. We heard, for example, from the Australian Nursing &amp; Midwifery Federation. Their comment was:
                              </p>
                              <p class="italic">
                               We note that temporary visa holders working in health and aged care under the visa class 457, 442 and 485 along with international students and working holiday makers now constitute a significant and growing temporary migrant workforce at a time when local nurses and midwives are struggling to gain employment.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               I wanted to note that for the record because Senator Macdonald was trying to say that these things have always been in place under previous governments. The point I am making is that the evidence the committee heard and that I have heard is that these kinds of visas are growing in number. Of course, we expect that under the 'fiesta' of free trade deals that are being signed at the moment they are likely to significantly increase, so the allocation of resources to audit these things I would have thought was absolutely necessary given the evidence that the Senate has heard.

                               I would like you to clarify whether under both visa subclasses 400 and 457 there are any circumstances where labour market testing is not required before granting foreign installers and service subclass 457 visas.

                                 I now have some questions to ask around amendment (6), which relates to licensing requirements. Previous to question time, I mentioned, in my summary of why we brought these amendments, that the Greens would like to see dual responsibility on both the visa holder and the sponsoring employer to provide evidence of obtaining a licence within 60 days. Essentially, we would like to put a reverse onus of proof onto the employer or sponsor. Can the minister perhaps explain why that is not a good idea and why that would not be a simple way of making sure that everybody had a valid licence and was therefore certified in their skills level to an acceptable standard under Australian law?

                                     I was just interested. Maybe I am being a bit simplistic, but, if you are bringing in new sets of regulations—and you are presumably drafting those at the moment—how will they interact with the agreement that we have with the Chinese government around things such as the licensing requirements that we have now? Given that they are signing a deal with us on the basis of what is in the substantive trade text, how will new laws impact on that trade deal?

                                       Once again, perhaps you could clarify for me. My understanding is that Australia has also agreed to review all remaining occupations within the next two years with the aim of further reducing the number of occupations or eliminating the requirement within five years. That is at annex 4, in the side letters. In relation to those occupations, we already have an agreement to remove the requirement for a mandatory skills assessment for the occupations of automotive electrician, cabinet-maker, carpenter, carpenter and joiner, diesel motor mechanic, electrician general, electrician special class, joiner, motor mechanic general, and motorcycle mechanic. How does annex 4 in the side letters fit in with the states and territories changing those laws?

                                        In relation to skills assessments, the department retains the right to request and undertake those skills assessments. As I said in answer to your previous question, they are not able to undertake any work until such time as they have secured the necessary licences, memberships or registration requirements under state legislation. Federal jurisdiction still relates and is capable of coming into force in relation to skills assessments.

                                             What I was more interested in knowing is: in terms of the skills assessment, is the employee or the employer or the sponsor responsible? As a follow-up on that, what assistance will the government provide to foreign workers to obtain skills assessments, if foreign workers are responsible?

                                                  The employer is required to pay the employee when they arrive in Australia. It would seem a little nonsensical or counterintuitive to be paying somebody when they are not actually qualified to work, because they have not gone through the appropriate skills assessment or gone through the appropriate processes to be registered or licensed or have the necessary membership to undertake the job. There seems to be a dual onus on both the employer and the employee, for fairly obvious market reasons, to ensure that these conditions are complied with before the person arrives in Australia and starts work.

                                                   At the FADT hearing, where we took evidence on the skills assessment process, once again, across a number of stakeholders, there was a significant concern that Chinese workers may not have skills and health and safety training of an Australian standard, which could lead to harm for themselves and others. Does the minister accept any of the detail that we have received in submissions indicating that this is the case?

                                                    As I have mentioned before, on a number of occasions, the workers must meet the skills requirements that are set down by Australian standards, Australian licensing and Australian memberships. I feel that we are arguing around in circles. I am saying to you that they do have to meet the Australian requirements—both the federal government's requirements for skills assessment and all of the core requirements of the state governments for licensing, memberships or registrations. I am not sure what additional information you asking me for.

                                                           Perhaps take that as a point of debate. I might leave it at that. I just wanted to be very clear, before this goes to vote, that the Greens feel that the Chinese free trade deal, in its entirety, has not got the balance right, in relation to the labour market. We feel that it is continued deregulation of the labour market. We have heard, directly, from a number of concerned stakeholders that this is not a pro-worker or worker-friendly trade deal. It is something that is of significant interest to a lot of Australians, especially working Australians.

                                                           As I mentioned, in second reading speech, if we had a trade treaty process that allowed for transparent and democratic input during stages of the treaty process, and we had an independent assessment of the national interest, these kinds of things would be captured. That is not just me saying that; that is the direct wording out of the FADT committee—which you are on, Acting Deputy President Back. You were also there for the treaty-making process inquiry, where we heard significant evidence about how fundamentally flawed and broken our treaty-making process is. That would take a lot of the politics out of these trade deals.

                                                           Clearly, there are a number of workers around this country—along with the union movement that represents them—who are deeply unsatisfied with this deal that we are about to sign and vote into legislation in this house. They are also very concerned, as a number of other Australians are in a broad section of the community, that the inclusion of an open-ended investor-state dispute settlement clause—

As the Acting Deputy President would well know, we do not need to give them special rights to be able to sue governments. They have been very good at doing this over a long period of time and, unfortunately, it leads to strategic litigation and it is a direct affront to the sovereignty of this country.

                                                           Once again, read the FADT report. It clearly says that the committee has concerns about the inclusion of ISDS. Those concerns are justified by a large number of stakeholders in this country who are quite respected across different sections of the community. The committee urged the government not to go down the road, in a few years time, when this ISDS is reviewed, by looking at things such as indirect appropriation. I am very pleased that today the Senate voted in favour of the Greens second reading amendment to compel the government not to go down that road in a few years time. Asking us to sign up to an ISDS agreement is bad enough, as it is, but an open-ended agreement—where we do not even know what we are signing into law today—is quite absurd given the level of public interest in this specific aspect.

These things add nothing but risk to our parliaments and they do not add anything to trade flows or investment flows between countries. There is no evidence that they do. They are simply unnecessary.

There has been a lot of hype. If it could be proven that it would have significant economic benefits, I think there would be a much stronger argument for us compromising on selling workers down the river or putting ISDS clauses into trade deals, but the Greens do not believe that is the case, and we will be voting against this deal. Who knows what is to come.

To their credit, in their address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech, the government said they would be known as a government of free trade. They have negotiated three agreements already and there are at least three or four more to come, one of those being the Trade in Services Agreement, an enormous agreement covering 38 countries. It is also being negotiated in secret. We have had one

I have heard from unions and workers in this country that they are more worried about the impact of the Indian free trade deal on Australian workers than they are about the Chinese free trade deal. But that is still to come. No doubt that will be lumped on us at the last minute too: 'Here, vote for this. It has already been signed. Like it or lump it.' At least we can have some kind of debate in here, through the committee system, about how we might change this legislation to improve the Chinese free trade deal.

On that basis, I seek leave to move Greens amendments (1) to (6). I understand that I have to move the amendments together because they have not been circulated.

                                                            Firstly, despite what we have heard today, particularly from Senator Whish-Wilson, about everything that you can possibly find that is potentially negative or that you can spin into a negative, it is not a reflection of the response I have received travelling around Australia and speaking to people who are the beneficiaries of these particular agreements. To say that the benefits are overstated I think is really unfair. There are myriad people out there seeing that these trade arrangements are going to be of massive benefit to them, to their businesses, to their economies and to their communities. Many of them are in rural and regional Australia, Senator Whish-Wilson. As you well know, coming from a small state, rural and regional Australia has been begging for a very long time to have positive opportunities. To say that we are selling workers down the river is just crazy. The opportunities presented by these free trade arrangements are job-creating opportunities for Australia; this is not a situation where Australian workers are in any way likely to be negatively impacted on.
                                                           </p>
                                                           <p>
                                                            In relation to the Greens amendment on the subclass 400 temporary work (short stay activity) visa, as I stated in many responses to questions asked by Senator Whish-Wilson, we are talking about a particular class of visa that has such a specific reason for being in existence and is extraordinarily short term. The average visa stay under this visa is just 20 days. When somebody is simply coming into Australia to play in a sporting tournament and they are going to be paid, to expect them to go through labour market testing strikes me as an overly unnecessary burden on them. For that reason, obviously the government does not support the introduction of labour market testing for subclass 400 temporary work visas.
                                                           </p>
                                                           <p>
                                                            As we have discussed ad nauseam here today, requirements for the 457 visas are very strict. People cannot come into Australia under a 457 visa if there are Australians who are capable of undertaking the same employment. As we said, the requirements of the states in relation to licensing, membership or registrations are mandatory and very strict. Anybody who comes into Australia on a visa is required to meet the requirements of that visa in relation to their skills. So there are massive amounts of protections that sit around 457 visas to ensure that Australian workers are not detrimentally impacted on. The fact is that many trade agreements that have been entered into, even those entered into under previous governments, have labour market testing requirements that are, if not identical, very similar to the requirements that we are requesting under the ChAFTA arrangement.

The first point I would make is that they say imitation is the greatest form of flattery, so I suppose we should be flattered that Senator Whish-Wilson has done such a good cut-and-paste job of including Labor's exposure draft amendments in relation to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. You did not do your own work, Peter—you just cut and paste the exposure draft that we put out.

                                                               I am sorry—Senator Whish-Wilson cut and paste what we put out. We put it out for very good reason—because we did think there were policy issues in relation to labour market testing which ought be resolved, and we achieved an outcome. We achieved an outcome by negotiation with the government around the matters that were canvassed in Labor's exposure. We have achieved outcomes which have legal force by way of regulation, and I will go through some of those again briefly.

                                                               I would take issue with one point that the minister made. I do not want to misquote her, but she made some comment about labour market testing continuing to be required. The government removed labour market testing under the chapter 10 provisions of the China free trade agreement in relation to a number of levels of employees—business executives and intracorporate transferees—which is, I think, unremarkable. It is uncontroversial—or it might be for Senator Whish-Wilson, but I think broadly it is not controversial. The government also removed labour market testing under the chapter 10 provisions for trades occupations—and that is a new thing in trade agreements. It is not the case in past trade agreements that labour market testing at that level has been removed. What is disappointing is that at no point has the government articulated the economic rationale for that.
                                                              </p>

                                                               Having said that, what we thought was important in the face of the very important economic relationship with China was to ensure that we achieved real safeguards by way of negotiation with the government. We went through a process of putting out draft amendments—which, as I said, Senator Whish-Wilson has now picked up—having a negotiation with the government and achieving the outcomes. I will go through them very briefly. Firstly, in relation to labour market testing, the outcome we have achieved is labour market testing on all work agreements—so not just the

                                                               s, investment facilitation arrangements—that are referenced in the China free trade agreement, which I think is a good outcome and it is included in regulation. I thank the government and Mr Robb for indicating that to us.
                                                              </p>

                                                               We sought a range of work agreement safeguards, and, again, a new regulation will be made which references the safeguards that Labor were seeking. In relation to Australian wages and conditions—and this goes to the chapter 10 issue—we were cognisant of the provisions of the ChAFTA and the fact that it was not going to be possible for the government to renegotiate those provisions. For this reason, as I outlined in my speech in the second reading debate, we have achieved an additional safeguard, which is in regulation that is legally binding, the requirement that the market salary requirement in what is called the TSMIT, the temporary skilled migration income threshold, must be assessed against enterprise agreement rates. We regard that as an important and significant safeguard.
                                                              </p>

                                                               In addition, in relation to skills assessment, as I went through in my speech in the second reading debate, we achieved significant improvements to the visa conditions and criteria in relation to individuals coming in on 457 visas who hold occupational licences or must hold occupational licences. I will not traverse again the additional visa conditions which have now been included and which we regard as a significant strengthening of the regulatory regime, because I did so in detail in my speech in the second reading debate. The opposition will not be supporting the Greens' amendments, because we believe that the outcomes that Labor identified some time ago in relation to these issues have been significantly resolved by way of the agreement we have achieved with the government in relation to the China free trade agreement.

                                                               As the opposition have also said, there remain issues in the temporary migration sphere. We have seen the exploitation of workers and we have seen the underpayment of wages. Many of these cases have been publicised in the media. These are issues to deal with the broader temporary migration framework, not specifically with the China free trade agreement, and we certainly believe that there is more work to be done in that area as we go forward. But I thought it was useful for me to outline the opposition's position in relation to the Greens' amendments.

                                                                I will provide a very brief clarification. Senator Wong is half right in relation to the flattery bit. Amendment (6) certainly was directly quoting the work that Labor did, but amendments (1) to (5) was work that we did. Nevertheless, in our point of view, they are all important amendments. Senator Wong, if amendment (6) is your good work I would expect you to support our amendment when it goes to a vote.
