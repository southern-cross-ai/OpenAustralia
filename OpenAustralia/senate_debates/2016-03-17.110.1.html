        My question is the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. Will the minister update the Senate on recent incidents of lawlessness in Australia's construction sector?

         I thank Senator McKenzie for her question. Just a few weeks ago I stood in this place and advised the Senate that, disappointingly, there were 73 representatives of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         who are currently before the courts. Unfortunately, the update today is that in that short period of time there are now 100 representatives of the CFMEU, one of the most militant unions in Australia, who are now facing charges before the courts. In fact, the number of charges now being faced totals 1,000.

         Many of them are actually in their full glory on the front page of today's
         <i>

         newspaper. Let us just have a look at what some of them have been fined. Gareth Stephenson, an organiser, has already been fined $118,000. Remember that it is the union members who end up paying the fines. Shaun Reardon, who has been dumped by

            , particularly in relation to right-of-entry breaches, has been fined $105,580. There are so many more. In fact, as I said, 100 of them are now facing 1,000 charges before the courts. But what do we hear from those on the other side, in particular from the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten? Deny, deny, deny. In fact, the very best that Mr Shorten's spokesperson, Mr O'Connor, can say is, 'Well, it's just a rough and tough industry.'

              As Senator Brandis said, really they are just some ordinary blokes having a good time. No, they are not. They are actually disrupting Australia's building and construction industry, in particular.

               Again, those on the other side—you can hear the interjections now—continue to defend bullying, intimidation and thuggery on building sites in Australia. Those on the other side have no friends in this regard. They may hear no evil, they may see no evil and they certainly would not speak any evil regarding the militant construction unionists within Australia. Let us look at a former Labor luminary, someone whom I believe all of us in this chamber would actually consider to be one of the more reasonable members of the Labor Party. That is, of course,

                 Unlike those on the other side, the government does take this exceptionally seriously. We believe that there is one law for both employers and unions. We do not make exceptions like those on the other side do. We stand for enforcing the law equally, no matter who is accused of breaching it. This government will stand up for workers, whether or not they choose to be a member of a trade union. This government is not going to be afraid of calling out bullying, intimidation or thuggery whenever we see it. This is a government that stands for transparency and accountability in relationships with workers.
