        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. The Prime Minister has stated that an Indigenous voice to parliament will consult Aboriginal and

         Torres Strait Islander

         Given I'm asked about the Voice, I would like to acknowledge, if I may, the ten leaders from Empowered Communities who are in the President's Gallery today as part of their visit to Canberra to advocate, from the grassroots, for constitutional recognition through the Voice to Parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Hanson, I appreciate your position on the Voice. I think you have made that clear, and probably no answer I will give you will satisfy you, because you have made your opposition to this clear. I would first make the point that the Voice is about two things. It is about recognition of Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         people in our Constitution, and it is about consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on matters that affect them.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the various aspects of detail, I would make two points. First, the referendum working group have already offered principles of what the Voice would look like. The second point I make is: if Australians see fit to change our Constitution in the way I hope they do, you, alongside every other member and Senator in this parliament, will have a say in how that Voice operates, because it is parliament that will legislate. There will be consultation and there will be legislation—just as you have a right, at the moment, to respond to and deal with legislation that comes before the chamber.

           Thank you, President. The point of order is on a matter of relevance. More than half the time the minister has to respond to my question has passed. I asked directly about what matters don't affect Aboriginal and

               Senator Hanson—through you, President—what Australians are being asked to vote on is a principle of whether there should be a voice. The detail will come from the parliament and the government that is elected by the people, and it is for the parliament and future parliaments to determine the detail of how it works, including the issues that you describe.

                  Senator Hanson, I think that everybody in this place, I would hope, understands that the challenges that we see—and some of our colleagues are living in

                   Alice Springs

                  and in the

                   Northern Territory
                  </a>
                  —are not new challenges, and to pretend otherwise is disingenuous. I would hope that the principle is that if you work with local communities and listen to local communities you achieve better outcomes. Senator Hanson, we come from very different political places, but I recognise that you do work in your community, you do engage with your community, and I would think you would understand that policy is intrinsically better if there is an engagement with, and a listening to, the community.

                    I hope you can answer my third question, because I've had no response to my second question, or my first one, for that matter. If the referendum rejects the Voice being inserted in the Constitution, will the government legislate a Voice that will clearly be against the will of the people?

We are hopeful that there will be enough people of goodwill in this place and in the community to ensure that we are able to do what was sought and insert a provision into our Constitution. That is what we are doing, so—
