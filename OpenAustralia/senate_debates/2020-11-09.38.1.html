        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne. Can the minister outline to the Senate the importance of Australia's enduring alliance with the United States of America, particularly in the Indo-Pacific?

         on their victory in the United States election, joining friends and partners of the United States from around the world. This was always going to be a strongly contested election, and we congratulate the American people on what was ultimately a smooth, calm and extremely well attended process. It speaks to the vigour of American democracy that both tickets attracted more votes than any previous candidates in US history—not only the ticket of then

         but also the ticket of President Trump and Vice President Pence. While President-elect Biden is, of course, yet to announce his administration, we know President-elect Biden and his team well, including from the government of four years ago.

         has been the linchpin of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific since 1945. It has helped to provide the basis for the rules based international order that has ensured, for so many decades, that the vast majority of disputes are resolved peacefully, through rules rather than through conflict. As one of the United States' closest allies, Australia is a proud contributor to the stability that this system has sustained. We are confident that, through continued US engagement in the Indo-Pacific, along with increasing engagement with and cooperation from other countries that share the same vision for our region, we can all continue to enjoy the benefits of an Indo-Pacific that is free and open, in which might does not equal right and in which all countries, large and small, can pursue their interests, free from coercion.

            This pandemic has wrought economic pain across our region. It has exacerbated strategic challenges that Australia and the US can help to address, together. Australia and the United States are cooperating in many areas, including on health security, on countering disinformation, on resilient supply chains, on open trade as we emerge from the pandemic and on supporting partners' economic recovery through targeted infrastructure development. We believe in a region in which human rights are respected, the seas and skies are open, and trade and commerce can flourish unimpeded.

               We look forward to working with the administration of President-elect Biden on a range of our shared priorities for the Indo-Pacific. Together with Japan, we've recently announced the first project under our trilateral infrastructure partnership, in the form of an undersea internet cable to Palau, supporting economic recovery through quality infrastructure. As a signatory to the Paris Agreement, Australia looks forward to deepening cooperation with the US on technology that creates jobs and reduces emissions, consistent with our low-emissions Technology Investment Roadmap. We will continue to progress the work we've done with partnerships such as the Quad—made up of Australia, the United States, India and Japan—to maintain a region that is governed by rules, not power. No country is more important to Australia than the United States, and it's never been more vital that we stand together.
