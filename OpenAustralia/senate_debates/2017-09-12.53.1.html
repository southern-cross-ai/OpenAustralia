        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        , Senator Scullion. Yesterday, Senator Brandis claimed that the government had already triggered gas export controls, saying, 'We have restricted gas exports.' Can the minister confirm the government has not yet restricted gas exports?

         I can confirm that we have constructed, with all in this place, a trigger that can ensure we direct current exports going offshore to inshore deposits. The question really goes to the timing of this mechanism and this trigger. If those opposite had actually focused on the piece of legislation and the regulations that flowed from that, they would know it doesn't matter when we pull the trigger between now and 1 November; the trigger doesn't come into effect until 1 January. You are just going to have to wait until after you open your presents! Just take a chill pill about this. We have until 1 November to pull the trigger on this mechanism, which has been put in place to send a clear signal to industry—which have obviously got the signal because there have been significant changes with regard to gas being placed on the domestic market.
        </p>
        <p>
         I call on those opposite to actually try to better understand the circumstances. I will explain again for their benefit,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         . You can pull that trigger today or tomorrow, up to 1 November, and on 1 January, by agreement with the industry and those in this place, that trigger will take place. It gives the industry two full months, eight weeks, to get that in place. The most important aspect of this is that we need to ensure that this is pulled when industry aren't moving themselves.

          <p>
           That is just simply not true. We have seen a number of significant measurements of gas, around 60-odd petajoules of gas, put on the market and taken away from offshore. There has been a gas swap involved. All of these have been changes that we think this mechanism has actually determined.

                   I think we have had much the same question, so rather than directing I will try to put it in a different context. It doesn't matter whether we pull it today, tomorrow or the next day; it will happen and will only happen on 1 January by agreement. I didn't hear a bleat from the other side that this process wasn't the right process when we brought in this regulation. We didn't hear, 'We need to suddenly turn the gas from offshore to onshore'—somebody wrestling with a large tap every day, running up to 1 November.

                       is that we now have a trigger. That's exactly what happened. There was no implication that the gas trigger had been pulled in the context of his very comprehensive and informative answer.
