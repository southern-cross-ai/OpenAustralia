         I will put a couple of general questions relating to the purposes of the bill. I would also like to acknowledge the amendments that Senator Johnston has just tabled. They actually go quite a long way, a remarkable way, towards quieting some of the concerns that have been expressed by those in the sector, by transport academics and by people who watch this area. So I would like to acknowledge quite genuinely that it is rare in this place to see errors as grievous as those contained in the bill not have to be shot out on the floor of the chamber but in fact moved by the government. It saves the opposition and the cross benches a great deal of time when a government of either political persuasion brings these amendments forward themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Johnston, I have a couple of general questions before we get into the substance and detail of the amendments that the Greens, the opposition and the government are proposing to move. Can you explain for us in simple terms why the Australian government has cancelled all funding for public transport and on what policy basis the Australian government has decided to get out of the business of funding urban rail infrastructure?

          I think that question is a bit of a distraction and away from the bill, but the point is that the government has chosen where it seeks to augment and facilitate productivity and to enhance the Australian economy. We have acknowledged that road funding, which is an integral part of public transport, is a very important part of infrastructure that has been neglected.

           I am also acknowledging, Senator Johnston, that this is not your portfolio. You are here in a representative capacity and you just have to make do with the best that your advisers can throw at you this evening. I found the answer profoundly unsatisfying. Are you aware of the productivity and economic benefits, agglomeration benefits and various other benefits in terms of quality of life and even just straightforward economic advantages of the Commonwealth funding public transport infrastructure? It is not only roads that have these benefits.

             No, with great respect, I turned up tonight to do my job, not to make your life easy. Apologies if those two things sometimes come into conflict. Irrespective of expert advice, irrespective of the board of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Infrastructure Australia
             </a>
             and irrespective of Michael Deegan, the infrastructure coordinator, the government decided—or I should say, really, that the Prime Minister decided from opposition; he telegraphed it, no-one can say that they were surprised or they did not see it coming—that it objects to Commonwealth funding for public transport. The Prime Minister said, 'We should just look after our own knitting,' or some utterly bizarre words to that effect.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do not understand why you would do that and it is directly relevant to this bill. The opposition has proposed sensible amendments that restore the independence of Infrastructure Australia, which you are proposing to take away. Why have you pre-emptively decided not to provide Commonwealth funding for an entire class of infrastructure?

              Since you have drawn me into this discussion, let me tell you that, as you know, there was a Senate inquiry into this matter. The department, of course, gave testimony to that inquiry. It set out that it did not agree that the bill would limit the type of project to be evaluated by
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               Infrastructure Australia
              </a>
              and, in particular, its ability to assess public transport projects. The
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Automobile_Association" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Automobile Association
              </a>
              also noted that it is neither the intent nor the practical impact of the bill to exclude proposals for investment in public transport. Gee, there is a revelation, Senator!
             </p>
             <p>
              Furthermore, the department noted that the act currently provides for Infrastructure Australia to evaluate proposals for investment in nationally significant infrastructure only by ministerial request. In contrast, the bill would enable this function to be performed without a ministerial request, except in relation to proposals in the class determined by the minister under 5A(1)(a) and (2).

               I do not intend to tie us up on this matter all night, because the minister is clearly not enjoying himself very much. Could you just clarify for us: in terms of the law, as it appears that the bill will be amended by the opposition and by ourselves, it is entirely open to the board of

                     I do not think it is a coincidence, I think this is policy. This is one of the few election commitments that the Prime Minister made that he has decided to uphold. Is it the case that the Australian government will not be funding urban rail infrastructure? That is a yes or no question.

                      What the government has done by saying that it will fund certain projects is to free up the states so that they can fund the projects of their choice. The rail projects that you are talking about are the sort of projects that the states are now more able to deal with themselves.

                            I am finding the interjections extremely helpful. I think the position here is fairly clear. I am sorry, Minister, that you have been lumbered with this dog and I recognise that this is not your portfolio. It is a shame—on behalf of everybody who believed the Barnett government when they said they were going to bring that project forward—that you ripped half a billion dollars out of it and the project collapsed.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            That is why I am putting to you, in fact, that when you take that money off the table it does not free the states up to do other things at all. It means that these projects collapse. The Brisbane cross-city rail project has collapsed. Work on the

                            project in Melbourne—and Senator Conroy will correct me if I am wrong—is dead in the water. Any extensions to Sydney's urban heavy-rail system is stuffed. In fact, what you have just told the Senate, which was that it would free up the states and territories to do that work, is actually directly the opposite of what is occurring. Will you undertake to advocate in your party room for a change of policy so that we can get these public transport projects back on the rails?

I will come back to some general questions a bit later in the debate, but let's just get started on the running sheet. I bring forward the first

                                amendment on the running sheet, which is schedule 1, item 8. I will put to the chamber what this amendment does, effectively, and seek opposition and government support. The current bill requires

                                to take into account forecast growth when it is conducting its audits to determine the adequacy, capacity and condition of nationally significant infrastructure. That is reasonable.

                                simply seek to add 'consideration of economic, social, environmental sustainability' when Infrastructure Australia performs these audits. Infrastructure Australia is a small team. It is not a vast government department. It is a relatively small, very expertise based group of people. So, effectively, what they are doing is outsourcing to the states and territories the primary work. When projects are brought forward for consideration by

                                Unless we embed these considerations in the process of conducting these audits to get a sense of where the major infrastructure gaps are, which is one of the most valuable functions that IA performs, unless we take into account the so-called triple bottom line of economic, social and environmental sustainability—conducted at the same time for the same piece of infrastructure and not done in separate silos—we are going to end up building the wrong stuff. In some parts of the country there has been a pretty sad history of doing exactly that.

                                   Minister, you might forgive the Greens for not taking you at your word when you say, 'Why would you omit economic, social and environmental sustainability when making infrastructure decisions?' You might not be too surprised that I do not take this government at its word that you would just automatically consider those things. The Prime Minister thinks climate change is absolute crap, and I will have a little bit more to say about that when we get to those specific clauses later in the evening. You do not have a very good record on this stuff—not you personally, Minister; but the government absolutely does not have a good record. In that case, I look forward to committing this amendment to the chamber. I move the amendment on sheet 7482 revised:

                                     amendment. It is very similar to one that Senator Conroy will be moving shortly on behalf of the opposition—amendment (2). I will go through it, although I suspect Senator Conroy will prefer his own form of words. However, I will explain briefly what we are proposing, which is to insert into schedule 1, item 8, on page 5:
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="italic">
                                     … to review and provide advice on proposals to facilitate the harmonisation of policies, and laws, relating to development of, and investment in, infrastructure;

                                     I presume that is reasonably straightforward. Again, I do not think we are teaching

                                     how to suck eggs here. We are creating some guidance and a framework for the kinds of things that need to be borne in mind so that we do not end up with a mish-mash, so that we do not end up, heaven forbid, with different rail gauges at the state and territory level. Heaven forbid that we could come up with something like that! I commend this amendment to the chamber. I will not be brutally offended if Senator Conroy believes that the opposition's form of words is better, but I believe in this instance that the Australian Greens have got it about right.

These functions are now to be exercised at the independent board's discretion. The first function relates to harmonisation of infrastructure laws, and this allows

                                            Chair, I will clarify. This amendment on sheet 7463 revised to schedule 1, item 8, is in two parts. Inserting (ga): 'to review and provide advice on proposals to facilitate the harmonisation of policies, and laws, relating to development of, and investment in, infrastructure,' is not a problem. However, (gb), which is also part of that item, states: 'to review Commonwealth infrastructure funding programs and their alignment with Infrastructure Plans given to the Minister under section 5B.' We are opposed to (gb). If my learned friend Senator Conroy were to break them up and move (ga) only, we would not be opposed. But we are opposed to (gb).

                                             Madam Chair, I think Senator Johnson is entitled to have the two questions put separately. I would indicate on behalf of the Greens, for reasons that I put fairly clearly in relation to the amendment that I did not end up moving, that the Greens would support both (ga) and (gb). They are very similar and in alignment with what the

I think it provides guidance and a framework around getting more harmonised infrastructure investment at the assessment stage. I would be keen to know why Senator Johnson would want to pull (gb) out and oppose it in particular: 'to review Commonwealth infrastructure funding programs and their alignment with Infrastructure Plans'. If we are not doing that process of iteration and saying we produce these plans, then what was it that was chosen and funded? What happened when the politics intervened? Did we still basically get it right? I think that is a very important feedback process. I indicate now that the Greens will be supporting both (ga) and (gb), whether they are put together or separately.

                                                    will be supporting these amendments. I do not propose to rub Senator Johnson's nose in it. I think it is quite refreshing to have something like this come forward, based not only on the work done by the Senate standing committee but also I think fairly widespread and widely understood views in the community that this is the right way to go. If the opposition has thereby withdrawn its amendment to that effect, we can move through this reasonably quickly.

                                                    Initially this was cause for us to vote against the bill in its entirety. I think Minister Truss has certainly recognised that this is about the independence. The last thing you want is for

That is what I was getting to before with a government's policy position that says that public transport no longer needs any kind of Commonwealth investment, even though these are very large—in some cases decades long and quite expensive—infrastructure projects that I think require a Commonwealth funding stream.

                                                    The government amendments also go to the fact that the minister would have been able to withhold the release of project evaluations that he did not like or that were politically inconvenient. Sometimes you are going to get inconvenient evidence from an independent body and you take the good with the bad; that is why we have these things. Keep in mind that Infrastructure Australia is not an executive body as such; rather, it is an advisory body. It provides to elected MPs—people who are accountable at least every couple of years—the benefit of its work. It is not actually a decision-making body so much as an advisory one.

As I said, this would have allowed the minister to exclude classes of projects. I am not sure, and I do not think anybody is very sure, what the motive was for the coalition to attempt to introduce such radical powers to weaken—

                                                            These amendments remove a further area of legislated ministerial interference from the bill. Item (1) defines 'quarter' within a year in a standard way. Item (6) uses that definition to require Infrastructure Australia to publish on its website summaries of proposals evaluated on a quarterly basis. These amendments are about transparency. Senator Ludlam, I saw the Senate seniority list recently and I am nearing the top, which is quite frightening really. But I have unfortunately witnessed many a National Party minister pork-barrel extensively. That is exactly why the minister sought to gut the independence of Infrastructure Australia. I smell pork. We should do everything we can to put the barbecue out.

It is just remarkable to hear Senator Johnston trying to justify opposing an amendment that would make a summary of evaluated projects live every quarter. What exactly is the problem with that? Infrastructure provision is not necessarily just best left to some kind of closed cabal of so-called experts. That is partly because this is taxpayers' money being expended and partly because people in regional and local communities have to live with the decisions that you make, such as dropping freeways over their backyards, putting coal rails past schools, choosing to extend an electricity grid to a particular region or choosing not to, or provision of clean water. People have to live with these decisions. I find it remarkable that the government would oppose much more frequent updating and publication of the progress of evaluations in some of these audits. I congratulate the opposition for bringing these forward. Again, they are similar to amendments that the Australian Greens had proposed. We are very happy to support them.

This is similar in intent to amendments that we moved before that were not supported by the government, but I am pleased to say they were supported by the opposition. If we imagine that infrastructure provision is best decided as though people live inside spreadsheets, that everything can be quantified and that really economic productivity is the only factor that you should pay attention to, then we will end up making very bad decisions. We have a history of doing exactly that. Yes, productivity is extremely important, although I wish the government would pay as much attention to energy and water productivity as they do to labour productivity. If they did that, it would lead to something of a revolution in the way infrastructure is designed and delivered. But, nonetheless, it is still an important factor that needs to be borne in mind. The

Item (20) improves transparency by requiring IA to publish annually the method and weightings it uses in its standard cost benefit method. This allows interested parties to understand and constructively debate how IA arrives at its project rankings. This is a healthy reform that helps states, proponents and the public understand IA's approach to project recommendations. These amendments are consistent with both independence and transparency. As I indicated, we are deferring to the Greens' item (15). I withdraw amendment (20).

Cost benefit analysis should not be undertaken in the plan. The infrastructure plan is not about individual projects and therefore it would be ridiculous to do a cost benefit analysis on a broad plan, if you follow me. Similarly, the 15-year plan was an election commitment in (8).

The first one, amendment (9), goes to the method of cost-benefit analysis that is undertaken, and this, really, is what the decisions that get made hinge upon—or at least the decisions that get published by way of advice from Infrastructure Australia to the minister.

We see this time after time; for example, in justifying urban freeway projects—and you might wonder how it is that, against the catastrophic cost of installing multi-lane urban freeways through existing communities and urban fabric, somehow a cost-benefit analysis can come back—if you are cooking the numbers—and say, 'the benefits of this freeway can amount to billions and billions of dollars'. You might wonder how on earth those benefits are calculated. It is relatively easy—and we ran into this problem with the
                                                                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">

But how on earth do you calculate the benefits? You can add up the costs—the cost of materials, the cost of labour, the cost of planning—but calculating the benefits of these things is inordinately difficult. And if project planners want the foregone conclusion to be that the urban freeway takes precedence over the urban rail, they just fudge figures and make numbers up, and effectively say, 'all that time that you will be spending zooming along the open road—now that we have decongested the freeway—adds up to billions of dollars in time saved because you got to work quicker'. These numbers are just pure hallucination. They mean nothing. What the Australian Greens want, as the amendment says, 'no later than six months after the commencement of this section' and then every 24 months after that first review, is to look at whether the cost-benefit analyses are actually performing for us—against social, environmental and economic costs and benefits; not simply performing an accounting trick that, in fact, you could get to deliver whatever result you wanted.

Again, you can calculate the cost of an infrastructure project because it is mostly hardware, and you can come up with an idea of the cost. To calculate the benefits of network infrastructure, you just need to make things up—and the results you get are entirely sensitive to your input assumptions and to how you weight them. We have no idea how Professor Ergas weighted his, but he came back with an imaginary number that said: 'Actually, don't bother: the costs of building the

Because these numbers carry such weight—they carry political weight, they carry economic weight; they carry enormous weight inside Treasury where decisions are made as to whether things will get funded or not—it means that the method of evaluation must be as transparent as possible, it must be reviewed, and it must take advantage of best practice elsewhere. Australian authorities and communities are not the only ones grappling with these very questions.

We want to see that published. That is the purpose of this amendment. How did you weight it? How big was your imaginary number—derived from the magic of being able to drive very rapidly down a new eight-lane freeway that has no traffic on it? It is fine that you have to come up with monetised factors to be able to weigh the scales of costs and benefits, but at least let us know what were hard data and what was pure fantasy. This is a very important amendment. I am very glad, I believe, that we have opposition support for it. I hope Senator Johnston has been persuaded, by the clarity of my argument, that probably one of the more important things we will do tonight is to provide a bit of a spotlight on the way that CBAs are undertaken in this country, so that we might actually get a little bit more honesty into the process. We have created that rolling review process precisely so that our methodology stays up-to-date as practice around the world improves. I commend these two amendments to the chamber.

The folly here is that we are linking a cost-benefit analysis to the plan; it is the project proposal that is subject to the analysis, and that methodology and that system are set out clearly on the website. I should remind senators that this system has been in place and working successfully, to some greater or lesser extent, for the past six years. I find it a little ironic that we are going to make these sorts of amendments. The government is opposed to these amendments.

If there was one single thing that we could do to improve legislation like this, and to improve what gets delivered to communities and to people who have to live in areas that these decisions impact, it would be to democratise the way that infrastructure is done. At the moment we have state planning and transport departments, with very uneven records of delivery, putting forward pet projects, sometimes in a bit of a rush, which

What kind of infrastructure is in demand here?' then you get a smarter answer. You get the wisdom of the crowd, and you get better proposals that come forward.

Labor proposes to retain it and leave it to IA to determine how to provide that advice. Item (11) adds a new area of advice sought by several stakeholders, the ability to conduce ex post analyses of projects to compare assumptions at the start with the actual process of delivery—what went right, what went wrong—so that all interested parties can learn and improve project delivery. Item (12) provides greater detail on these reviews and adds a role for IA to provide public education on part 5C advice matters via its website. IA effectively plays this role currently. Item (9) is a consequential renumbering. Once again, these amendments enhance independence and transparency.

'We cannot support the direction that the opposition'—and I should say the crossbench—'wants to take the bill in'—in the direction of greater transparency and climate literacy. Senator Johnston, climate change actually is a thing. It really actually is a thing. It does exist. I know it is hard to believe, but it actually really does. And I will indicate at the outset that the Australian Greens will be supporting these amendments. I do not think the Labor Party goes nearly far enough, so I will have a bit more to say about climate change, as, I suspect, will Senator Milne, when we come to move the next Greens amendment. My understanding is that what the Labor Party has sought to do here is simply reinsert the existing language from the existing act and put it back in where it belonged—that is, up to date, to this time—and that it has had climate change as one of the material factors it needs to evaluate when it is seeing projects roll in. That washes back through the states and territories so that they know that this is something that

Is this project going to survive the age of climate change? Does it massively increase greenhouse gas emission? It is not perfect. I do not think it has worked particularly well, which is why the Australian Greens amendments go so much further. But it is extraordinary that the coalition sought to remove it as a material fact.

We are basically living in a different kind of world and potentially in a different geological age. That is the reason we propose much stronger language in this bill around the way that

Third, there is the role of infrastructure in decarbonising the economy. I am probably as guilty in this respect as anybody. We have spoken at length about public transport but infrastructure is, among other things, the electricity grid that keeps everything moving. As I said in my second reading contribution, the role of infrastructure in urgently decarbonising the economy is a massive principle—you could say it is primary. That has to be front of mind for those assessors in Infrastructure Australia when they are considering which projects should be granted billions of dollars of funding and which should not. Finally, there is the impact of infrastructure decisions on the achievement of national and international targets to limit global warming. As everybody in this chamber is aware, except those who have chosen to simply blindfold themselves to what is going on, the infrastructure decisions that we make are locked into very long lead times. For example, if you build a coal-fired power plant today its investors will be assuming it will still be operating in the 2040s or 2050s, long after this technology will need to have been phased out if we are to have any chance at all of coming to grips with what is occurring all around us.
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                     If on the one hand we have climate negotiators at international conferences arguing that Australia is doing its bit, as the rest of the world is now starting to do, and adopting very stringent targets around carbon reduction, eliminating the sources of emissions that are doing so much damage, we cannot at the same time have an industry portfolio and an infrastructure portfolio making long lead time capital investment decisions over 40 or 50 or more years that make it completely impossible to meet those targets. That is something that Infrastructure Australia needs to be very aware of when it is prioritising and choosing what to recommend and put forward. I hope Senator Conroy will have had a profound change of heart. I know he has been concentrating intently on my contribution, as I am sure Senator Johnston has. This amendment should be passed into law tonight.

We think we have covered the general thrust so we will be opposing this amendment.

Let me go to the first point in the amendment—the economic, social and environmental impacts of climate change. Let me take Roma as an example. We have had the shocking flooding in Queensland and we have had terrible storm damage as well. If the levee issue had been addressed in Roma in 2005, the estimated cost at the time would have been $20 million. Subsequent to that, since 2008, $100 million has been paid out in insurance claims in Roma and since 2005 over $500 million has been paid out by the public and the private sector for the repair bill. That is just one example where, if we had taken the climate predictions and scenarios seriously and moved in and built the infrastructure we needed to build when it was needed, we would have saved not only incredible distress in that community caused by the flooding; we would have saved an enormous amount in terms of infrastructure costs and replacement.

That cost goes to billions in terms of the infrastructure repairs, not to mention the insurance costs and the fact that several people in those communities have subsequently not been able to get insurance for their homes and businesses. When this goes to further infrastructure, we have had railway lines buckle in extreme heat; we have had roads wash away; we have had energy systems brought down and real risks of mega-blackouts and brownouts because of loss of energy infrastructure in the course of those extreme weather events.
                                                                                       </p>

                                                                                        The question has to be asked: at what point is Australia going to recognise that for Infrastructure Australia, assessment of projects has to include the worst-case scenarios for climate adaptation? A moment ago my colleague Senator Ludlam spoke about decarbonising the economy, which is essential. Let me give you the example of the bushfires in Victoria—sparking from overhead powerlines was one of the main causes of huge loss of life. Significant recommendations have come from the royal commission that in order to remove those risks, powerlines need to be undergrounded or, alternatively in some places, to cease and to not have the infrastructure going out there. Instead have renewable energy systems that are decentralised, so you are actually protecting the communities but stopping the potential for sparking in between. That is the kind of anticipatory action that the Victorian government, together with the power companies—the distribution and transmission companies—should have been bringing forward to Infrastructure Australia to look at reducing fire risk and cost in the longer term in Victoria. Those actions give you competitiveness in terms of power supply, more safety in terms of fire, and less in infrastructure costs. They are the sorts of things you need to be considering.
                                                                                       </p>

                                                                                        in a recent report: that there is a very real risk that Australia will be bypassed for the foreign capital that is necessary to fund infrastructure in this country, because the international capital flow is going to go to countries that are dealing with the real risks associated with climate change, that are decarbonising the economy, and that are building the kinds of infrastructure that will serve a decarbonised economy into the future. By going in the wrong direction and not putting these climate considerations at front and centre, Australia stands to be effectively bypassed by international capital, because that capital will assess climate risk in any project. It is not just the climate risk in terms of the loss of that infrastructure; it is climate risk in terms of whether that infrastructure becomes a stranded asset—sunk and dead capital into the future. There is no doubt in my mind that there are plenty of ports up for proposal in Queensland that will end up as stranded assets if they are built, not to mention the coal railway lines and the mines that are being considered.
                                                                                       </p>
                                                                                       <p>
                                                                                        In recent times there have been several cancellations with regard to major infrastructure projects in Queensland—not least of which is a big port—because international capital has been withdrawn from the projects on the basis that it is likely to be a stranded asset. Given that the Chinese are going to cap their climate emissions and their use of coal, anyone who invests in a coal port in Queensland is sinking their money into a dead hole and an asset divested from major pension funds and other funds around the world. If there is one thing Infrastructure Australia really needs to be looking at, it is those two essential elements—the costs to infrastructure into the future of a changing climate and the frequency and intensity of weather events; and, secondly, how Australia is going to fund the infrastructure that will lead to the decarbonisation of the economy and to attracting foreign capital into that infrastructure assessment. That is where I feel Australia is going to get further and further behind unless we actually deal with this. That is why I argued at the time that the one-off flood levy was a bad mistake—we should have a permanent fund which looks at doing preventive investment in infrastructure so we can minimise risks to people and property, minimise costs into the future and bring down and control insurance premiums.
                                                                                       </p>

I know the coalition does not care about this and is prepared to keep on seeing people end up with their houses devalued—there are places on the New South Wales coast now where if you are on the flat and subject to storm surge, your insurance premiums are so high that the value of your property is now really diminished compared with properties on the same street that are much higher up. It is becoming pretty obvious to people everywhere that failure to take this seriously is something that every Australian is going to be confronted with. The government could move to get some futuristic scenario planning and serious risk assessment done, rather than to pretend it is not happening, to pretend it is a one-off and to pretend that every time it happens we will somehow find the money to deal with it.
                                                                                       </p>

It makes absolute sense to protect this country as best we can from damage, and to anticipate where we need to spend money and how we need to spend money to (a) create more jobs and investment; and (b) to protect communities from the ravages that are coming.

It should not be too much to ask.
                                                                                        </p>

What it puts in place is, firstly, the impact on local ecological services and ecosystems. This can be as simple as, for example, new sea walls or as important as modifying coastal environments, which can have catastrophic and largely unforeseen effects.
                                                                                        </p>

This is one of the areas where I had—although I respect him greatly for his independence and his intellect—dust-ups over a period of six years with Mr Michael Deegan, the Infrastructure Coordinator. The dust-ups were over Infrastructure Australia's methodology for working out what the future price of oil was going to be. Working in a carbon constrained future does not simply mean dealing with the pollution impacts of carbon emissions from the coal, oil and gas sectors; it also means dealing with the depletion aspect. This idea that we are just going to continually double up freeway infrastructure, for example, as though there is an infinite amount of oil on the planet, is mad. That kind of calculation needs to be factored into the way IA contemplates its prioritisation of infrastructure projects.

The impact on social amenity and the social licence from local communities for infrastructure projects—some of that is often forgotten.

At one end of the spectrum, that simply means that these projects end up being significantly delayed or much more expensive than they should have been in the first place. At the other end of the spectrum, you end up with effective community opposition to projects that end up being stopped—a lot of planning resources and expertise and a lot of money wasted, and communities being forced on the defensive to fight repetitive acts of stupidity that they simply should not have to. That is what is going on right now in Melbourne, Sydney and Perth—around Commonwealth infrastructure projects that were not on the priority list, projects out of nowhere that have been brought forward and funded. For projects like the Roe 8, the Perth Freight Link, the bureaucrats at the table during estimates week did not know where the project went, what its alignment was, whether it was an elevated freeway or whether it was going to simply dump vast amounts of container traffic into the approach roads to the Port of Fremantle in North Freo.
                                                                                        </p>

Infrastructure is not just about spreadsheets and concrete pours; it is about people and it is about the landscapes and the host communities in which these projects are built.

This is one of the ones, as we discussed at the outset, where we think the government has substantially addressed the concern we sought to raise with our amendment. So I might let Senator Johnston run the argument for me when he, shortly, stands up and moves government amendment (3). That amendment is not entirely satisfactory, but there is substantial overlap between Greens amendment (12) and government amendment (3), which effectively talks about transparency and accountability. Rather than detaining us longer than necessary, therefore, we will not proceed with Greens amendment (12).

The background, which Senator Ludlam invited me to comment upon, is that government amendment (3) deletes section 5D, which provided for functions to be performed only when directed by the minister.

                                                                                                </p>

I am not one of those people who believes that commercial-in-confidence considerations trump everything else—trump the public interest and trump the public's right to know. Commercial-in-confidence is used almost as widely as 'national security' as a proxy for simply closing debate down and precluding the release of material that belongs in the public domain. We believe that material, including commercial-in-confidence material, should be published where it is necessary to assess the public benefit of a proposal or an evaluation paid for by taxpayers dollars.
                                                                                                </p>

                                                                                                 Prime Minister Abbott signed a $900 million cheque to the Barnett government to build the railway white elephant, while claiming a cost-benefit ratio of 5:1 and refusing to publish the supporting material. They are saying that you just have to trust them. This absurd freeway—this affront to the local community, the ecosystems and to the Aboriginal heritage—has a 5:1 cost-benefit ratio, and you cannot know how that figure was arrived at. You just have to trust the government. Well, guess what? We do not.
                                                                                                </p>

My understanding is that Senator Johnston is moving amendments (5) and (6) together and then will separately put the question that we will collectively oppose clause 3. If that is the way you run it, the Greens will be supporting these amendments.

I am hoping the Clerk will assist in confirming that.

I just hope that Senator Conroy has run into a little bit of an administrative error at about this point and that they do not propose to oppose a Greens amendment that says that local communities are a group that should also be consulted with in performing its functions. This is something that goes to the heart of the way that infrastructure is done. They cannot sit in an office on the other side of the country, dropping infrastructure projects in from

That was a process that went deliberatively into the city of Perth, surrounded a random sample of residents from all quarters of the community with experts and ran an extraordinary process, which came out with a blueprint that was actually very green. You get the right answers if you ask good questions. We are not asking for a great deal more than that. I hope that Senator Conroy now leaps to his feet and says that it has all been a terrible mistake and that local communities are actually materially important when it comes to assessing infrastructure projects. I commend this amendment to the Senate.

The bill seeks to allocate this role to a public servant, potentially outside IA. This change vests that role in the CEO, just as it sits now with the Infrastructure Coordinator. This is an important Labor reform, which was introduced in the 2013 budget, aimed at encouraging greater private sector involvement in public infrastructure projects. It is appropriate that the infrastructure experts in IA retain this role to cement its role.
