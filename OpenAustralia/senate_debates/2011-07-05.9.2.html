        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Is the government aware of reports that the Moola Bulla Station in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        must comply with a destocking order and dispose of over 3,000 head of cattle, and that many other stations in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        will shortly have to do the same?
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that there is no export market for these cattle and they are essentially worthless to sell, the owner will start shooting cattle at the rate of 200 a day, starting tomorrow. The only viable solution other than shooting cattle is to sell them into the live export marketplace. Given this, and that the government are aware of abattoirs and supply chains in Indonesia that meet their desired standards, when will the government fix the looming disaster that they have created and reopen the live export trade with Indonesia?

         I thank Senator Scullion for his question. I do understand that the media are reporting that the owners of a Kimberley station say that they will be forced to cull about 3,000 cattle in the wake of the ban on live exports to Indonesia. Nico Botha from Moola Bulla Station near
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halls_Creek" rel="nofollow">
          Halls Creek
         </a>
         has indicated that they will start that culling tomorrow. Mr Botha says that there are currently about 25,000 head of cattle on his property and that those are the numbers that need to be reduced.
        </p>
        <p>
         As soon as I became aware of these claims by Mr Botha, I did the following. My office asked the ABC for the contact details for Mr Botha so that we can see what assistance we can provide to him. I have asked Centrelink, through the Minister for Human Services, to make contact with Mr Botha and, once again, to be provided with contact details from the ABC. My office has also alerted the Cattle Council of Australia to Mr Botha's comments and has asked them to make contact with him to see what assistance is available. And, of course, I will continue to monitor the circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are, as I indicated, three types of assistance that have been provided. Firstly, there is a $30 million aid package which provides for payment for hardship through Centrelink. In addition to that, there is assistance through the Cattle Council of Australia for onshore supply issues that may arise of $5 million. In addition to that, there is industry assistance for those who have been made unemployed as a consequence of the suspension. I also indicate that those opposite—

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given the fact that these cattle are worth approximately $600 a head, can the minister explain which program this grazier should turn to in order to compensate him for the loss of around $120,000 a day that he will lose through shooting rather than selling cattle due to the government's decision to end the trade?

           I indicated in answer to the primary question that there are two specific packages. There is a $30 million package for a two-part payment which is provided for this type of assistance. In addition to that, there is also onshore supply assistance which is designed to assist with feed, watering, agistment and defraying the costs of transportation, which the Cattle Council of Australia has provided a $5 million outline for. In this instance, the contact details for Mr Botha will be made available to us and, as I have indicated, we will be in contact with Centrelink to provide that assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
           What those opposite are obviously asking for is that the trade be resumed immediately. What we have indicated is that when there is supply chain assurance in place, the trade can recommence.

             What those opposite did in the 10 years that they were in government—and they had the ability to address this animal welfare issue—was nothing. They did nothing. What this government has done is sought to ensure two things. It has sought to ensure that we have a supply chain assurance in place which maintains animal welfare outcomes. What we are keen to ensure is that that area provides for a supply chain assurance. The opposition have now just abandoned their—

                Of course, the Australian cattle industry is an area where we do want to continue this trade for the longer term. Those opposite want to ensure that it does not continue for the longer term. It is at risk without the suspension in place. The industry has an opportunity to ensure animal welfare outcomes.
