        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health. Can the minister confirm that the declaration of conflicts of interest is a standing item on the agenda of the Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation? Can the minister confirm that she chaired a meeting of the forum, which was attended by her chief of staff in Melbourne on 13 December 2013? Can the minister also confirm that her chief of staff's interest in a food industry lobbying firm was not declared at the forum?

         Yes, I can confirm it was an item on the agenda. Yes, I can confirm that I was chairing the meeting. Yes, I can confirm that my chief of staff did not declare an interest. I was fully aware of the relationship between my chief of staff,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APA" rel="nofollow">
          APA
         </a>
         and his previous role with Cadbury and the confectionery industry. As stated in my speech to the Senate last night, my chief of staff complies with proper internal standards under the Statement of Standards for Ministerial Staff, as those on the other side would have heard me advise the chamber yesterday. As I also said, in addition to complying with proper internal standards, his spouse gave undertakings that both she and the company would not (a) make representations to either myself or Minister Dutton; (b) make representations to the

          Department of Health
         </a>
         ; or (c) make representations on behalf of any clients to other ministers of the Commonwealth in relation to the health portfolio. My chief of staff took proper and appropriate steps to prevent any conflict of interest with the private business of APA and by withdrawing from any work from APA, and on that basis there was no conflict of interest at that meeting.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that ministers, staff and officials are required to declare conflicts of interest at meetings of the Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation? Why did the minister and her chief of staff fail to meet this requirement at the meeting she chaired on 13 December?

           Perhaps the senator was not listening to my previous answer. I clearly answered all of those questions in my first response.
