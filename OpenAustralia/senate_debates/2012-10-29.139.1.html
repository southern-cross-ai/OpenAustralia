        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Ludwig. I refer the minister to the government's decision to effectively deport 80 Australian-trained medical students after its failure to fund their internships and the breakdown in negotiations with the states. Does the minister agree that people studying medicine in Australia have a reasonable expectation of being provided internships in Australia in order to complete their qualifications?

         I thank Senator Nash for her continued interest in rural matters, particularly in the health portfolio. My brief does not have anything specific on this particular matter. It is certainly a matter that I will take on notice and get back to you with a proper brief. It does sound that the question would fall more properly within the immigration portfolio as a general response.

            It is more accurate. I will get a brief from the health minister but once we start talking about deportation matters it does seem to be more relevant to the immigration minister and decisions made by the immigration minister. It does seem, though, that if we talk about the key messages from this issue, the

            and the minister have been very focused on providing support for rural Australia, providing additional measures, unlike the previous government, which ripped a billion dollars out of the health system. Since 2007, we have been delivering better health services for Australians. We have delivered more than 900,000 elective surgery operations, 2.2 million

              But if the substance of the question was to say that this government has not been proactive in the health portfolio, then it would be an error to say that. If you look at the work that the minister has done in this area, particularly by increasing hospital funding by 50 per cent and investing in emergency department upgrades of 37 hospitals, then it would be wrong to suggest that.

               that part of this is a good news story. Can the minister explain what part of sending Australian internships overseas is a 'good news story'? What is the point of training more medical students through Australian universities if they cannot finish their training in this country?

                In this instance, I thank Senator Nash for her continued interest in rural health matters. If we talk about additional internships, Commonwealth funding may be available to fund the additional 100 intern positions in the private sector through the redirection of $10 million from the Prevocational General Practice Placements Program, but it goes to the heart of what I said earlier. If you look at what this government has done, particularly in providing training, higher education reforms that have resulted in 150,000 students attending university, you will see health disciplines have experienced substantial growth, including growth between 2007 and 2011. There has been a 39 per cent growth in the number of medical students. I think Senator Nash, in this instance, is looking at the wrong end of this stick.

                 , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the shortage of medical practitioners in regional Australia has been estimated to be as high at 1,600, how can the government possibly defend its internship decision considering the cost of fixing the problem is only $8 million, or about one-tenth of what Labor spent on advertising its carbon tax compensation?
