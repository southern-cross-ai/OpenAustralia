        My question is to the

         Leader of the Government in the Senate
        </a>
        , Senator Brandis. I refer to recent reports that on the day that Australia signed off on the China free trade agreement, Mr Huang Xiangmo paid $100,000 into trade minister Andrew Robb's personal campaign fund, the Bayside Forum. Was this conflict of interest raised to cabinet before or after the cabinet's deliberations over the China free trade agreement? And if not, does this not just reinforce the case for a national anticorruption watchdog?

         Penny, he doesn't need any coaching from you! Sorry, that was off the record!
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Di Natale, you should know better than to ask me about cabinet deliberations. The deliberations of cabinet are never an appropriate subject of a question because they may not be the subject of an answer. You know that, Senator Di Natale.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am aware of these reports. I am not aware of whether they are accurate reports or not. I am merely aware of the allegation. But I can tell you, Senator Di Natale, knowing Mr Robb as I do and having worked with him as a colleague and known him as a friend for many years, I regard Mr Andrew Robb as a person of the very greatest integrity who has now left politics and who is pursuing a career in the private sector, as he is perfectly entitled to do. I dare say that if Mr Robb had not given the prime years of his career to public service in the parliament he would be a very wealthy man, but he is not because he gave a period of public service for over a decade.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, in relation to the broader question of foreign political donations the government's position is very clear. Following the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the topic, the Prime Minister announced that the government would move to ban foreign political donations. That is a matter that Senator Ryan, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
          Special Minister of State
         </a>
         , and I have under review at the very moment. We mean to do that. As well, the Prime Minister has commissioned me more broadly to look at the law concerning foreign interference, to see where that can be reformed to protect Australian interests.

           The Landbridge Group, who are significant donors to the Liberal Party and the Bayside Forum, are now paying Mr Robb a salary of $880,000 that commenced before he had even left the parliament. What actions did Minister Robb undertake to facilitate the Foreign Investment Review Board approval that allowed control over the Port of Darwin to the Landbridge Group?

           <p>
            Let me correct a fact that you assert wrongly, Senator Di Natale. Mr Robb left parliament on 9 May, 2016. As a retiring member of parliament, he ceased to be a member of parliament the day the writs were issued for the 2016 election. So let there be no confusion, deliberate or accidental, about the time at which Mr Robb ceased to be a member of parliament.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Foreign Investment Review Board makes decisions independently. Its minister is the Treasurer, not the ministers for trade and development. Although I have no personal knowledge, I would be quite certain, Senator Di Natale, that, because of the way in which these decisions are made, Mr Robb would have had no involvement.

              Has the Attorney-General directed his own party to stop taking money from Mr Huang Xiangmo and Mr Chau Chak Wing? If not, without a national anticorruption watchdog, how on earth can the public trust that the government's decision-making over the China free trade agreement and the FIRB approval of the lease of the Port of Darwin was made in the public interest and not corrupted by political donations?

               Senator Di Natale, I do not raise money for the Liberal Party. However, as a member of the Liberal Party's federal executive, I do accept some obligation in relation to oversight. I can assure you, Senator Di Natale, that all of the Liberal Party's obligations—and I am sure the same applies for our coalition partner, the National Party—under the

                   No, because that would not be my role in any event. But what is my role, as the Attorney-General, is to prosecute the policies of the government.
