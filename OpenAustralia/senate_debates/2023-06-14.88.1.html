        My question is for the Minister representing the Attorney-General. I have repeatedly asked the government to provide the legal advice they received around the impacts of the Voice to Parliament on the sovereignty of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Peoples" rel="nofollow">
         First Peoples
        </a>
        of this land. I was directed to the Referendum Working Group statement from February this year, which simply stated: 'All members of the expert group agreed that the draft provision would not affect the sovereignty of any group or body.' Given that my repeated requests for this directly to the minister remain unanswered, can you please provide me with the definition of 'sovereignty' that was used for this assessment?

         Thank you, Senator Thorpe. You're right; you have repeatedly asked this question. In fact, I think I answered it in estimates many months ago, when you asked the question of me and the officials who were there. And we do keep telling you, but I know that you keep coming back with that question. The fact is that the expert panel on the recognition of Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         peoples sought advice on this issue. The advice was simple—that is, that constitutional recognition does not in any way foreclose on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         sovereignty. The Uluru statement is clear that enshrining a voice to parliament in the Constitution is linked to recognising the ancient sovereignty of our First Nations peoples. The Uluru statement states, as I'm sure you're aware:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         With substantive constitutional change and structural reform, we believe this ancient sovereignty can shine through as a fuller expression of Australia's nationhood.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's why the Albanese government is looking forward to working with the community and all sides of politics, and I recognise there are people on all sides of politics who support recognising our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Peoples" rel="nofollow">
          First Peoples
         </a>
         in our Constitution and there are people on all sides of politics who support doing that through a voice to parliament. We look forward to working with everyone who supports that occurring, everyone in the broader community and First Nations people, the overwhelming majority of whom support recognition and a voice to parliament. We look forward to working with all of them to achieve a voice to parliament in the Constitution through the referendum that we'll be having later this year.

           Just on relevance: the question was around the definition that was used to determine what sovereignty of

             Unfortunately, Senator Thorpe, every time we have attempted to answer your questions about sovereignty—you obviously have a very strong view on this, and I know you have an agenda politically around the Voice to Parliament and it is based on this question of sovereignty. Every time we answer the question you're not satisfied with that answer, and you come back effectively asking the same question. We keep saying this to you.

It's not a debating time—there's plenty of other opportunity to do that—and that's what you're starting to do. Minister Watt, please continue.

                                      Senator Thorpe, please resume your seat. Once again you are getting into a debate rather than calling a point of order. I agree with you that the minister should stick to the question and not—
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      Senator Thorpe, I am attempting to answer your point. I will ask the minister to refrain from making a personal reference to you and to stick to your question. Thank you, Minister.
