              We support this motion. We acknowledge and praise the work and commitment of Australia's healthcare professionals and healthcare workers. These valued Australians provide compassion, care and support for many everyday Australians in need. Referring to paragraph (c), though, we note that nations like Taiwan—which has a similar population to Australia—quickly learned that they just had to isolate the sick and the vulnerable, and that allowed healthy and productive people and businesses to keep working and earning money. The result is that their economy remained healthy and they had far fewer deaths than in Australia. The truth is that this government did not refresh Australia's COVID strategy in April when Taiwan and other nations proved that their strategy worked and was far superior to ours. The government has exposed healthcare professionals to a needless risk.
