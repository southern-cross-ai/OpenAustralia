           On 31 August and 1 September I stood in this place in response to a Labor motion calling for a royal commission into banks. I said then and I will say again that if we are going to go to the time and expense of a royal commission we should do it right. We should broaden it to take in all white collar crime. We should broaden it to take in industry super funds and the fees that they have siphoned off to the unions and then into Labor's war chest. I wonder if people in this chamber are aware that, as I read recently, over the past two years industry super funds paid more than $5.4 million to unions and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
            ACTU
           </a>
           , with a fair portion of that flowing to the Labor Party. Get the terms of reference in, give us the detail and make sure you include industry super funds, group insurance and the strong connection between the Labor Party and the union movement. Let's have a proper royal commission is what I am saying.
