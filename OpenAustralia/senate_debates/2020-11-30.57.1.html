        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. There are nearly one million Australians unemployed, 1.4 million underemployed and 2.8 million relying on government support, and unemployment is on the rise. How many of the 25,000 Australians who recently joined the unemployment queues were forced there because of the Morrison government's withdrawal of support?

         Our government, through this crisis period of the pandemic, has sought not only to respond to the health crisis and to achieve what are global-leading results in terms of protecting Australians from the health risks of COVID-19 but also to respond in unprecedented ways in terms of support for the Australian economy. Just as the health results are amongst the best in the world in terms of the resilience that Australia has shown, so, too, are our economic results amongst the best in the world. That is not to say that there aren't Australians doing it very tough. There clearly are. Today we note the announcement by Qantas in relation to job losses that will be sustained at Qantas and changes that company is making to try to ensure its resilience into the future.

          I hear the interjections from those opposite, who seem to pretend that, in a world where global aviation has been battered to its core, there is some easy solution in relation to these matters. There's not. You can't live in the fantasy world of those opposite. The reality is that we have put in place, through the JobKeeper mechanism, the single largest intervention in the Australian economy by a government in our peacetime history ever, and in doing so we have helped to sustain and save many thousands of jobs, and we have helped to sustain and save many thousands of businesses. But we said at the outset it was never going to be possible to save every single business or every single job, given the nature of the crisis that we face. But we are continuing to invest, having created JobKeeper and extended JobKeeper, and of course now pursuing, through our budget, a range of policy measures designed to drive jobs growth in the economy, to help with the recovery and to get people back to work as quickly as possible.

             We outlined at the beginning of the pandemic, in our economic response, that what we sought to apply were measures that were temporary, targeted and proportionate. They have been the principles that have guided the government's response through this crisis, with some $507 billion in financial support for the Australian economy, representing some 25.6 per cent of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
              GDP
             </a>
             . That record level of support has provided a lifeline to so many individuals. But, in terms of the temporary, targeted, proportionate nature, we have also been taking careful steps and decisions in relation to JobKeeper. Those careful steps and decisions have seen JobKeeper go through a number of steps and iterations that do see eligibility—

               In the eight seconds the minister has left I wonder if he could be directly relevant to the question, which was the economic impact of the decision to withdraw JobKeeper and JobSeeker in March. We've had a lot of process, a lot of rhetoric, but there was a question which Australians are deeply interested in.

                   has also warned the Morrison government to avoid withdrawing vital support from the economy too early. How many Australians will lose their jobs as a result of the Morrison government ignoring these warnings?

                    In the last five months we have seen some 650,000 jobs recreated across the Australian economy. This has been a result of the types of measures that our government has put in place to give the economic stability and lifeline that Australia needed. The senator referenced the

                    , if you want to look at the global comparisons, you see that economic growth in Australia did indeed in the June quarter contract by seven per cent. However, if you look across comparable nations, we saw that in Germany it contracted by closer to 10 per cent, in Canada by closer to 11½ per cent, in the
