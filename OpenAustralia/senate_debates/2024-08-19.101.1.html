        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. The Albanese Labor government has just signed the A
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        US 2.0 agreement. One of the many issues under the agreement is that allows for the US to provide one-year's notice and walk away from the deal if it thinks it would be detrimental to the US military to provide Australia with nuclear submarines or materials. Keeping in mind that the US does not make enough submarines for its own needs and won't for the foreseeable future, why did your government sign up to an agreement that will allow the US to walk away at any moment and take all their stuff with them?

           I need to say it more often—that the Greens don't support A

            UK

           US? I know that you don't support AUKUS. Obviously, the question is motivated from the perspective of someone who doesn't actually think that this is a good thing for the country. We do. There has been a lot of work that has been undertaken, including in the US. I acknowledge the work of Ambassador Rudd in working with both sides of politics in the US to ensure that domestic legislation was passed in really quite extraordinary time frames to try to lock in as much progress as is possible.
          </p>
          <p>
           The reason we support AUKUS is that we think it is central to the protection of the nation. Of course, it would be good to live in a world where we didn't need these sorts of hard decisions.

               In relation to the terms of the agreement, which will go through the normal parliamentary process, obviously, that was negotiated between the parties. There will be aspects of it no doubt that will attract scrutiny. I would make the point that no government can ever assure forever that a future government will do something, and that is unsurprising. I am pleased to report to the Senate the extent of bipartisan support for A

                 Minister, under this agreement, if the US ever sells us a second-hand submarine and then that breaks down and the reactor starts leaking radioactive waste into Australian waters and harming sailors and the environment, it's Australia, not the US, that has to pay the damages under this agreement. Why would you agree to indemnify the US in this way?
