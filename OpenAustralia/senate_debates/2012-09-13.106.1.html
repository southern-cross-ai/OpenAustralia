        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr. As a student of American history as well as Minister for Foreign Affairs, does the minister place any weight on theories that the 2001 attacks on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center" rel="nofollow">
         World Trade Center
        </a>
        in

        </a>
        and on the Pentagon were a false flag operation or a US-Israeli conspiracy? What is his view of the groups which promote such theories which believe that not enough is known about the reasons for these attacks, that huge questions need to be asked about why one building came down without being hit, about whether this was due to controlled explosions and about what happened to the bodies and the plane at the Pentagon?

         I do not know what information the senator is seeking, but I think all rational participants in Australian politics would see September 11 for what it was: an aggressive attack on the United States which justified what the Howard government did in invoking the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">
          ANZUS
         </a>
         Treaty—with the support of the opposition. It was an attack launched by jihadists, who were prepared to do anything to achieve their goal of mass civilian slaughter. We are all united in our condemnation of it.
        </p>
        <p>
         I commemorated September 11 at the US embassy this week. I was proud to speak, and to speak I think for all members of this parliament, when I made the points I did. We can be satisfied but not complacent with the fact that in the 11 years since September 11 there has not been a comparable attack on a Western capital because of excellent intelligence work, the sort of intelligence with which we cooperate with our American friends and other allies very closely. We cannot be complacent because the prospect of an attack using a weapon of mass destruction, such as a backpack nuclear bomb or a suitcase nuclear bomb, remains very real. We have all said on many occasions that Western intelligence has to win 100 times out of 100; the terrorists can fail on 99 occasions and enjoy a breakthrough on their 100th attempt. I believe security agencies in Australia should take some satisfaction from the fact that there have not been serious attempts.

          , I thank the minister for his comprehensive answer and ask a supplementary question. Does the minister believe it is appropriate for parliamentarians to knowingly meets with groups like Truth Action Sydney which believe not enough is known about the reasons for the 9-11 attacks and, in particular, to go so far as to promote events such as the 'Delusion 911' public meeting held on an earlier anniversary of the 9-11 attacks?

           I do not know what can be done about paranoia and conspiracy theories that circulate in politics. I do not know whether it is possible to have a rational argument with people who believe in those propositions and I really would not devote much time to it. I know there are websites set up in Arabic by quite good agencies to puncture such conspiracy theories and to present the uncontested facts about events such as September 11. I would simply caution against guilt by association, however, and that anyone who has encountered someone who holds such absurd theories is, by association, guilty of holding them themselves.

            , I have a further supplementary question. Does the minister believe that the promotion by Australian politicians such as Senator Rhiannon of groups such as Truth Action Sydney is helpful in enhancing our international alliances, including with the United States? Does the minister have any concern about the government being in alliance with a party whose members promote such groups?

             I think the Senate should take account of all those occasions in which the coalition has voted with the Greens party to defeat measures by this government. Based on that logic, you are associated with those theories. That would be as logical as saying that this government, because it has had the support on some measures of the Greens party, is somehow implicated in misthought, in these absurdities, in these conspiracies. I would not even dignify such a view by branding it
