         <p>
          Tonight I would like to speak about the devastating bushfires experienced earlier this summer in my state of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          and the loss of the historic town of Yarloop. Initially, I would like to pass on my deepest sympathies to all those affected by bushfires this summer, both in Western Australia and elsewhere throughout our country. I cannot imagine the hardships that the victims of these bushfires have experienced. However, I saw the catastrophic losses caused by these fires in Yarloop when I visited last Friday.
         </p>
         <p>
          Yarloop is a small town of roughly 550 people situated 130 kilometres south of Perth. It was a historical centre of rail transport and has been classified as a conservation area by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trust" rel="nofollow">
           National Trust
          </a>
          . I have been associated with Yarloop for a couple of years now. Out of its small population, Yarloop saw 200 servicemen fight in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
           First World War
          </a>
          , with 60 young men killed. Astonishingly, two of the men that returned were awarded the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
           Victoria Cross
          </a>
          for valour. As patron of the Darling Ranges Sports College I have had the pleasure of accompanying students, along with my very dear mate
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Davis" rel="nofollow">
           John Davis
          </a>
          , to the Yarloop War Memorial before we headed off as a group overseas to tour the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front" rel="nofollow">
           Western Front
          </a>
          battlefields in Belgium and France. Yarloop is a great example of the astonishing contributions that small communities can make, and this demonstrates why these fires were all the more devastating.
         </p>
         <p>
          I was invited to visit again this year by a good friend, Les Liddington, and his lovely wife, Merrilyn. Les fought the fire to save his house but was eventually forced to leave and ended up losing everything they both owned. The destruction of Yarloop was just incredible, and I can just share this with you if I may, Mr Acting Deputy President: it was surreal. There were homes that were absolutely razed to the ground, and yet next door there were homes that were not touched. I know that would not come as a surprise to you, being a good country person who has spent all your working life, and living life, in the country, but I just could not get over how certain homes were chosen and they were the ones that were going to go, and how terrible a feeling that would be for everyone there.
         </p>
         <p>
          But out of the tragedy there comes one little bit of good news. Les had been battling a six-foot tiger snake in his yard and its six or seven babies for quite a while, and he could not catch that tiger snake no matter what he did. He said the tiger snake would rear up and have a crack at him every time he went outside. But he was proud to show us, amongst the rubble, the charred remains of that six-foot tiger snake. On that, you have to have a little smile. Les turned to me and said, 'Well, at least I don't have to worry about that bloody snake anymore.' Excuse me—those were his actual words.
         </p>
         <p>
          The argument over who is responsible for the devastation caused by these fires, unfortunately, has started. Importantly, however, all sides of politics need to help the locals, who now have the difficult decision of whether to relocate elsewhere or to stay in Yarloop. I would like to express my thanks to all those involved in fighting the fires, as well as those who assisted in the clean-up and are helping to restore power and essential services to Yarloop.
         </p>
         <p>
          During the time I spent with Les and Merrilyn I was told of the many terrible things that occurred during the fires. Les will wait for the inquiry, and he hopes to put his name forward so his voice can be heard. Les has returned to his burnt-out house. He only left at the very last minute. He was burnt on the face and the chest, but he was back the next day, and since that day he and Merrilyn have been living in a caravan on the site that was their home. As I left Yarloop I asked whether there was anything I could do for him, and the only thing that he requested was 20 Australian flags to display on the remaining homes. I intend to deliver these flags personally, and I welcome any other
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australian
          </a>
          representatives who are willing to join me and see for themselves the destruction of Yarloop and the surrounding districts.
         </p>
         <p>
          As my mate
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD" rel="nofollow">
           JD
          </a>
          and I were pulling away, Les called to me and he said, 'Mate, tell them not to forget about us.' I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I will not forget about Les and Merrilyn or any of the other victims of these fires, and I will do everything I can do to assist in any way I can. I want to do it bipartisanly, and as I said—and I say this from the bottom of my heart—if any government senators want to join me and come down, you will be more than welcome. The people of Yarloop would love to see you, and the last thing that I will entertain here is playing petty, stupid politics when 180 homes have been burnt to the ground.
