        My question is to Senator Kim Carr, the Minister representing the Minister for Disability Reform. Following the passage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme legislation through the parliament yesterday, what action is the government taking to now deliver that scheme?

         I thank Senator Moore for the question and commend the work she undertook along with Senator McLucas. There is no more noble a task for government than giving people with a disability and their families and carers an opportunity to have a better life.

         We have delivered $1 billion in new funding for the first stage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Now that the legislation has passed, we will be launching the scheme in five sites across the country from the middle of this year. The government is hiring staff and building offices in the launch sites. About 26,000 people with a disability will benefit from this first stage—people in the Hunter in

         . About 140,000 people with a disability will benefit from a complete rollout of the scheme across New South Wales by July 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are establishing the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency as an independent statutory body. The National Disability Insurance Scheme will transform the lives of people with disabilities, their families and their carers. For the first time they will have their needs met in a way that truly supports them to live with choice and dignity. This is an achievement to be very proud of, and it is something that, I trust, enjoys the full support of this parliament. I trust that that is actually demonstrated as the scheme is developed.

           Senator Moore, I am sure you are only too well aware of the great strengths of the new proposal. The current scheme for supporting disabilities is in fact broken. It is a system that reacts to crisis, a system where families only receive support if they are unable to continue in their caring role and where there are no other options, a system that has compared itself to a lottery where even the best outcomes are unsatisfactory.
          </p>
          <p>
           The scheme the government is introducing will work with families before they reach crisis. It will work with them to make sure that valuable informal care that they provide is actually sustained. It will foster innovation in services that are delivered and coordinated by local people. The government's solution is a demand-driven system of care tailored to meet the needs of individuals, a system that is proactive in approach to improving the lives of millions of Australians.

             we are attempting to work with the states to deliver the scheme. It is abundantly clear that some states need to get a move on. They need to match their words with actions and they have not shown a grasp of the most important feature of this reform. The government has written to the Victorian government asking them to sit down with us. Senator McLucas has had the lead role in this area to ensure that there is a rollout across the state. Premier Napthine needs to do a great deal more than what his predecessor was prepared to do. He needs to make sure he signs up to the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme across Victoria as a top priority. Mr Barnett, the
