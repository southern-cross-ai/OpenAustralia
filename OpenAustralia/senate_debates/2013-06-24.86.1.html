        On 20 June, Senator Payne asked me a question in relation to the Remote Jobs and Communities Program. I have some further information in relation to that question and I seek leave to incorporate it into

        , the Hon Julie Collins has announced the providers for all of the Remote Jobs and Communities Program (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJCP" rel="nofollow">
         RJCP
        </a>
        ) regions as at 24 June 2013.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Applicants for RJCP were required to demonstrate connections with the communities in the regions for which they applied. Successful providers include organisations which have been delivering
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Services_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Job Services Australia
        </a>
        , Disability Employment Services or the Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) Program as well as organisations which have been undertaking other programs, services or business activities in remote Australia. Many partnering arrangements have been developed which will strengthen local service delivery.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All RJCP providers have footprints in their remote Regions, for example, as current service providers with pre-existing presence, by accessing the facilities of local subcontractors or partners, or by putting arrangements in place to commence RJCP on 1 July 2013.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Providers for the regions announced on 24 June 2013 have existing presence in these regions. Transition provisions for job seekers and communities will support continuity of employment, participation and key community services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are comprehensive transition arrangements for the RJCP which will commence on 1 July 2013 to provide employment, participation and community development services for around 33,000 job seekers across remote Australia.
