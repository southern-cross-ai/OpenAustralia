        I must say that this question has been developed from the contribution of thousands of Australians, and the question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Across recent history the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        has criticised Australia's human rights record under previous and current coalition governments, subjected us to a barrage of criticism over asylum seekers and offshore detention and criticised the boat turnback policy. We've been rapped by the special rapporteur on torture and accused of chronic noncompliance that was off the charts, meaning we had very little to be proud of. Reportedly, the member for Denison wants to refer coalition ministers to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court" rel="nofollow">
         International Criminal Court
        </a>
        for crimes against humanity. Why does Australia continue to support an organisation that allows genocide, torture and true crimes against humanity to go unchecked and waste time undermining our border security?

         I thank Senator Bernardi for his question. I think it's very important to remind ourselves of the importance of effective multilateralism, of the importance of the contribution that it makes to protecting and promoting the rules based international order, that it makes to contributing to our own objectives in the Indo-Pacific.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia focuses on contributing to an efficient and effective
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         . We don't always agree. In fact, we have robust differences of opinion from time to time within the UN and its associated agencies and bodies, like the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Human Rights Council
         </a>
         , of which we are a recently elected member. But the contribution to those things, where strong global cooperation sets a tone, where it sets in place rules and norms for constructive diplomacy in every region of the world, is a very important part of Australia's engagement and has been thus since the inception of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         , where Australia was a founding member 70 years ago. We see a period of rapid and accelerating change and we see times of rising nationalism and geopolitical competition, but that does not mean that we should walk away from those organisations in which we have the opportunity to argue for the rules based international order and in which we have the opportunity to protect and promote those systems and processes which enable us to solve problems together. Our most urgent global challenges are not going to be solved by any one country acting alone. There are a vast number of them. As Senator Bernardi has alluded to and as I have said explicitly both here and elsewhere—

           According to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
            DFAT
           </a>
           annual reports, when the coalition took office, Australia contributed $193 million that year to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
            UN
           </a>
           . Unlike self-funded retiree slow rates of return on investments, the UN has a enjoyed 46 per cent funding increase over the coalition's six-year life span, to $282 million. Australia has been ravaged by drought, cyclones and bushfires, so why do we keep increasing aid funding to a body that condemns us?

            I do think it is an invidious comparison to suggest that our relatively reasonable contribution to bodies such as this prevents this government from making the contributions that we do in relation to natural disasters and emergencies in our own country. This government has taken significant steps to support those most seriously affected by the worst of natural disasters recently, whether they have been floods, fires, cyclones, drought and ongoing drought, which we acknowledge is an extraordinary challenge for those suffering. This government does not accept this is an either-or proposition. We are able, through the management of a strong economy, to play a responsible role in the international community and to contribute to security and stability in so doing, but also to support those Australians in greatest need.

               When Senator Bernardi raised those issues of concern, the government—and other senators, I may say—has of course made appropriate investigations. I acknowledge that some of those have needed to be addressed. Some have come to nothing. I am not for a moment claiming that the system in which we operate internationally, the rules based international order which we work within, will always solve and address every problem. The world would be a very different place if it could. But the contribution that Australia makes, as a supporter of the rules based international order, as a contribution to security and stability in our own region and elsewhere, is a very important one. We have been a leader in this context for decades and decades. We raise concerns when we have them. We engage in robust discussions and debates with those who run—
