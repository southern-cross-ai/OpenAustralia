         As we know, small and family businesses are the backbone of the Australian economy and supporting them is in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">

         of the Liberal-National government. On this side of the chamber, the Morrison government, we know that a fundamental role of government is to ensure that our nation, the nation of Australia, has a strong economy. As the Leader of the Government has said: why do we need a strong economy? Well, without a strong economy, you cannot deliver record funding for education. You cannot deliver record funding for health. And you certainly would not be able to guarantee the essential services upon which Australians rely.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is why we will always put in place policies that will ensure that Australia has a strong economy. Of course, those policies will back small and family business every step of the way. Under the coalition government, under the Liberal-National government, we have seen the creation of almost 1.2 million jobs since we were elected to office. How do you create jobs? You put in place the policies that ensure that businesses are able to prosper and grow and, of course, have a strong economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've been able to deliver, because of the strong economy, tax cuts for 10 million Australians. You cannot give tax cuts if you don't have the economic fundamentals right. We've been able to give tax cuts to not only up to 10 million Australians but also the 3.3 million small and family businesses in Australia, because we know that, when Australians have more money in their back pockets and when small and family businesses have more money in their back pockets, they'll invest in themselves and they'll spend more money. In doing that, businesses are able to prosper and grow and create more jobs.

            Just recently, when the Senate wasn't sitting, I had the opportunity to travel to the great state of Tasmania and spend time with Senator David Bushby. Whilst we were in Launceston, we met with a number of small and family businesses. In fact Tasmania is home to more than 7,000 small businesses, and, as Senator Bushby knows, our government is committed to putting in place policies that will help them prosper and grow. We met with a gentleman by the name of Lindsay Bourke. Lindsay Bourke owns Australian Honey Products. They have some of the best honey in the world, often known as manuka honey. Lindsay has actually taken advantage of the free trade agreements that we signed as a government. Having been able to take advantage of these free trade agreements, Lindsay now exports Tasmanian-made honey all over the world. That's what backing small and family businesses is all about—ensuring they have opportunities to prosper and grow.

               There wouldn't be nearly as many free trade agreements if those on the other side were on this side of the chamber, and, if free trade agreements aren't entered into, it means businesses in Australia are not able to look to the global market to sell their products. That's why Senator Birmingham is out there every day looking for further opportunities for small and family businesses in Australia—to ensure their products are able to get into the channels that will take them overseas. And, of course, a fundamental difference, as we move towards the next federal election, is: do you want to pay higher taxes? If the answer to that is yes, vote Labor. If you want to have a government that will do everything it can to lower your taxes, whether it's personal income tax or the tax you pay as a business, vote Liberal-National. There's a fundamental difference. Higher taxes: vote Labor. If you want a government that backs you and backs lower taxes, vote for the Morrison government.
