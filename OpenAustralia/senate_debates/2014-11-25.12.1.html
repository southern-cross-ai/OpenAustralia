        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I refer to the minister's answer yesterday that nobody has lost their job at the ABC. Is the minister aware that at least 300 of the 400 redundancies will be given effect this Christmas? Will the minister now correct the record?

         The situation in relation to the ABC is a matter for ABC management and its board. So to suggest that it is the government's responsibility in some form is to miss the point. Indeed, what I would say to ABC management is that it is called the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Broadcasting Commission

         true reason. It is supposed to represent all of Australia. Under current management, you could be forgiven for thinking it is called 'the

            That does not happen in Hobart, it does not happen in Adelaide, it does not happen in Gladstone but it does happen in Ultimo and that is where the ABC management need to come to grips with its charter and the aspirations of the Australian people.

                  , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to yesterday's concession by the Minister for Defence that there would be '4.5 per cent of ABC cuts over five years'. I also refer to Senator William's confirmation that the Prime Minister promised before the election 'there would not be any cuts to the ABC and it was spot on that the Prime Minister should admit it'. If Senator Johnston and Senator Williams can admit the Prime Minister has broken his promise, I ask the minister: why can't the Prime Minister?

                   It is interesting how the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
                    Australian Labor Party
                   </a>
                   are so exercised about cuts to the ABC because when the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
                    ALP
                   </a>
                   are asked, when Mr Shorten is asked about what cuts he would make, his answer is, 'We haven't finalised our proposition for government.' When he was asked further, 'We don't think the cuts need to be as deep as they are. In other words, he understands that cuts need to be made to the ABC. Then he went on to say, 'We wouldn't be making the same extent of cuts to the ABC.' What mean and tricky language is that—'not to the same extent'? So tell us, to what extent, Senator Lundy, would the Australian Labor Party cut the ABC?

                         'no carbon tax'. The ALP made a promise that there would be no carbon tax, a tax which destroyed thousands of jobs throughout the Australian economy and especially in the manufacturing sector. That is why we got rid of that tax—to preserve jobs. Senator Lundy, I can say to you and your colleagues that that is what motivates us as a government, to get the economy back on track. In circumstances at the time the Prime Minister made his statement about the ABC, Mr Bowen said the deficit would be $18 billion. At the end of the year it was $48 billion as the failed finance minister well knows.
