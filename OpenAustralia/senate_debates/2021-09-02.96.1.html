        This amendment is the one that I talked about in my second reading speech. It is time to stop the rot and stop appointments of people who are political mates of Attorneys-General. Whilst this is not a complete remedy, it goes a long way, and I urge the chamber to support it.

         Labor does not support this amendment. Senator Patrick has argued that this amendment would ban political appointments, but that is not the case. It would simply limit the Liberals to appointing mates who have law degrees. Indeed, many of the Liberal mates the government has appointed to the tribunal have been lawyers. There are many examples of this, including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Frost" rel="nofollow">
          William Frost
         </a>
         , who is now paid $250,000 of taxpayers' money each year. He went straight from Mr Porter's office to his plum new job on the tribunal. William Frost is a lawyer. For all we know, he may be a very good lawyer and he may even be a highly competent tribunal member. I note Senator Seselja assures us he's a very good lawyer, so now I'm wondering. But his appointment, along with the appointment of so many other mates of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Porter" rel="nofollow">
          Christian Porter
         </a>
         and other ministers of this government, gives rise to an understandable perception in the community that the tribunal is not independent of government, that it is not fair and that it is not impartial. Senator Patrick's amendment would not address that problem.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is a significant amendment, but not for the reasons Senator Patrick suggests. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
          AAT
         </a>
         is not a court; it's a merits review tribunal. The role of a tribunal member is to stand in the shoes of the original decision-maker, such as a minister or a senior public servant. Ministers and senior public servants are not required to be lawyers or certified accountants, so why should all tribunal members—people who are required to stand in the shoes of the original decision-maker—have to be lawyers? There is a legitimate and important debate that we could have about whether the AAT should be more like a court in terms of who sits on it. Perhaps, as Senator Patrick suggests, the tribunal should be made up of only lawyers. Perhaps the parliament should say that 90 per cent of tribunal members must be lawyers or that certain divisions of the AAT should only be made up of lawyers whereas other divisions could have greater diversity. These are legitimate questions, but they are weighty ones. Just to ask these questions is to illustrate that Senator Patrick's amendment has significant implications for the tribunal which extend well beyond the problem of political appointments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor has been consistent in calling out the government on its brazen stacking of the AAT, and we'll continue to do so. Over the last eight years, about 80 Liberal mates have been appointed to the tribunal, many of them lawyers. It's a shameful record and it has done great damage to the tribunal and to the standing of the tribunal in the community. Any suggestion that Labor did it too is completely false. In fact, over the six-year period when Labor was last in government, only two people with Labor connections were appointed to the tribunal, and both were highly qualified and uncontroversial appointments which enjoyed bipartisan support. As it happens, they were also both lawyers. One was Duncan Kerr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SC" rel="nofollow">
          SC
         </a>
         , a fantastic appointment warmly welcomed by the then shadow Attorney-General George Brandis. The other is now an associate professor of law,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Kirk" rel="nofollow">
          Linda Kirk
         </a>
         , another appointment supported by the Liberals.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor has always maintained that membership of a political party is not a disqualification for appointment to the tribunal. But, under the Liberals, it has become the main qualification, and the tribunal has been turned into a taxpayer-funded gravy train for Liberal mates as a result. There are 80 Liberal mates in secure jobs, collectively taking home many millions in taxpayers dollars each year. It's a disgrace. There is nothing in section 7 or anywhere else in the AAT Act that requires the Liberals to stack the tribunal, and the amendment proposed by Senator Patrick would not stop them from stacking the tribunal with more of their mates. The best way to stop political appointments to the AAT is not to support this amendment; it's to vote the Liberals out at the next election.

            made by this Part apply in relation to an appeal that is instituted on or after the commencement of this item.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a very technical amendment, but, again, it's a recommendation that flows from Justice Callinan, the esteemed High Court Justice—and there has been a lot of judicial debate over this question—about whether or not the tribunal can be appealed on a question of law, or preferably, as my amendment seeks to do, on an error of law. That might not seem very different for people who are not lawyers, but, as someone who has had to deal with these sorts of things, it does make a fairly big difference.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point in time, I will comment that, in relation to my

            matter on the national cabinet, it appears as though the government is not appealing that. They are seeking apply Justice White's ruling by way of legislation. I will know later tonight. I will leave that as a comment. I commend my amendment to the chamber.

             Labor does not support these amendments. Senator Patrick's amendments would implement measure 23 of former High Court Justice Ian Callinan's review of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
              AAT
             </a>
             , which says:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Amend s 44 of the
             <i>
              AAT Act
             </i>
             to provide for appeals from decisions of the AAT, for error of law in lieu of a question of law.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr Callinan offers only a very brief explanation for this recommendation. He writes:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The identification of a discrete
             <i>
              question
             </i>
             of law can be problematic. Fact and law are sometimes inextricably mixed. For clarity, appeals should be for errors of law rather than on a question of law.
            </p>
            <p>
             With all due respect to Mr Callinan, his report does not identify an actual problem with the existing language in section 44 of the AAT Act. He merely asserts that it is unclear.
            </p>
            <p>
             While we are open to considering this amendment in the future following a proper consultation process, we do not think it has been sufficiently explained or justified by Mr Callinan. Nor was this recommendation considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee in relation to this bill.

                   In its current form, the bill would confer the same protections and immunities on Immigration Assessment Authority reviewers as are currently conferred on High Court judges and members of the

                   . In Labor's view this proposal is misconceived. It is wrong, and this amendment would remove that aspect of the bill.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Reviewers of the Immigration Assessment Authority should not be treated the same way as judges or AAT members for the simple reason that they are not required to act like judges or AAT members. For example, unlike AAT members, reviewers of the Immigration Assessment Authority do not have to take an oath of office, do not have to have special skills or knowledge, do not have terms fixed in advance and are not statutorily required to disclose conflicts of interest. Unlike AAT members, Immigration Assessment Authority reviewers are also not required to afford procedural fairness to applicants.

I commend this amendment to the Senate.

                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Act" rel="nofollow">
                      Australia Act
                     </a>
                     1976 to allow the Federal Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, to provide short-form reasons rather than detailed judgements where a decision dismissing an appeal does not raise any questions of general principle. As Labor senators of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee noted in their report, that aspect of the bill has been criticised by the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, the Josephite Justice Office and the Law Institute of Victoria on the basis that it will disadvantage unrepresented applicants, including those seeking review of refugee decisions. We share those concerns, and I'm moving this amendment to remove that aspect of the bill. I understand the government will be supporting this amendment, and again I thank the Attorney-General for listening to our concerns. I commend this amendment to the Senate.
