Can the minister explain why casuals employed for fewer than 12 months, local government workers, many university and non-government school workers, temporary migrant workers who can't go home, most arts and entertainment workers and many charity workers have been excluded from the JobKeeper program?

         I thank the senator for her question. This relates to exactly why the parliament is here today legislating the government's historic $130 billion package to ensure that an estimated six million workers are connected with their employers throughout the COVID-19 crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the senator's question: because the government had to draw a line somewhere. A package of $130 billion covering almost six million workers will be passed by the parliament today. This is an incredible package. It has been carefully designed. As you know, it applies to full-time workers and part-time workers and, as the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Relations" rel="nofollow">
          Industrial Relations
         </a>
         and the Minister for Finance have acknowledged, the definition of 'casual' that has been adopted for the purposes of this legislation has been taken from the Fair Work Act: casuals who have been in employment with their employer for a period of longer than 12 months.
        </p>
        <p>
         But this does not mean that the employee categories that the senator referred to are not recognised by the government. They are. They will be, in some circumstances, able to apply for the jobseeker allowance. This is, of course, with the additional supplement that has been provided by the government in relation to COVID-19. This is a historic package that will pass the parliament today. It applies to in excess of six million Australian workers. It is a generous package. But, ultimately, as the Prime Minister, the Minister for Industrial Relations, the Treasurer and the Minister for—

               I think, with respect, Senator Cash has been speaking for only 10 seconds. The question is not being answered necessarily in a way that people would like, but the turn of phrase I heard the minister using then was actually turning directly to JobKeeper—unless I misheard. So I am going to say that I consider it to be directly relevant. Senator Wong.

                , the question was very simple, very precise and very pithy: 'How many casual employees will miss out on the JobKeeper program?' The minister then said: 'It's not a question of how many will miss out; it's a question of how many are in.' With respect, Mr President, it is not consistent with your previous rulings for you to rule on this occasion that such a complete mirror image of the question can possibly be directly relevant.

                   On the point of order, we have always allowed ministers an element of time to turn to a question. This question, I remind the minister, was very specific in its nature. The minister has only been speaking for 10 seconds and I don't think had got quite to a full-stop. I am listening very carefully to the minister. I will happily entertain other points of order later on in the answer if people feel that way but at this stage I think it is inappropriate for me to rule that the minister is not being directly relevant. Senator Cash.

                    As I was saying, casuals are actually catered for if they have been in an employment relationship with their employer for longer than 12 months. In relation to the question asked by the senator, many casuals will still be in employment because there are a number of industries that are currently ramping up and recruiting. In terms of casuals, as the Minister for Finance has acknowledged, the JobKeeper and jobseeker programs are actually complementary. How many casuals are currently earning less than $1,500 a fortnight? More than 50 per cent. Around 41 per cent of casual employees had been with their employer for under 12 months as at August 2019 and they will not—

                      Can the minister confirm that under the government's legislation the Treasurer will have the power to extend JobKeeper payments to these casuals and to other excluded workers?

                       I understand that the Treasurer has today uploaded a number of rules that will be made in relation to the JobKeeper payment, and the Treasurer has stated—and the government actually stated at the time—that this is an evolving situation and we continue to monitor it. But, to go to your point, Senator Walsh, there are two types of payments: JobKeeper and jobseeker. If you are not eligible for JobKeeper, then you are able to look at whether or not you will be eligible for jobseeker. The two payments—as the Minister for Finance has so eloquently pointed out—are actually complementary.
