           Act provides for detailed assessment of proposals that are likely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance, as well as opportunities for public comment. The assessment process will include consideration of potential impacts on the Aboriginal cultural heritage values of the Western Tasmania Aboriginal Cultural Landscape. The government will progress the proposal from the Tasmanian department in accordance with law.

              I thank Senator Whish-Wilson for this motion. I'm able to stand up and say that I don't support keeping Arthur-Pieman closed for the people to enjoy. I won't lock off areas of my great state so that nobody gets to enjoy them. I say clearly that I don't support the motion. My question is whether or not the state Labor leader, Bec White, will do the same, instead of sitting in the middle. When she was asked for her thoughts yesterday, she offered no position whatsoever. We are now going into a state election. Labor wants to have a foot in both camps—for and against. It wants to look like it is friends with the Greens and keep its options open in case it needs some extras to make sure it can make government.
