       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will amend the
        <i>
         Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006
        </i>
        (OPGGSA) to strengthen the offshore petroleum regulatory regime. It is focussed on important compliance, safety, integrity and environmental management objectives, including implementation of measures associated with the Government Response to the
        <i>
         Report of the Montara Commission of Inquiry
        </i>
        . In particular, the Bill will strengthen the application of the "polluter pays' principle in the regime, by requiring offshore petroleum titleholders, in the event of an escape of petroleum resulting from the titleholders' activities, to stop, control and clean-up the escaped petroleum, and remediate damage to the environment. In addition, the amendments implement a third party cost-recovery mechanism in the event the titleholder fails to comply with its statutory duty. Further amendments will ensure titleholders must provide evidence of sufficient financial assurance to cover expenses and liabilities arising from offshore petroleum activities, to the satisfaction of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA), prior to commencing those activities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Among other measures, the Bill also includes amendments to provide the ability for NOPSEMA inspectors to issue environmental prohibition notices and improvement notices to offshore petroleum titleholders to remove threats to the environment arising from petroleum operations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasons" rel="nofollow">
         Reasons
        </a>
        for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the context of recent serious safety and environmental incidents in the offshore petroleum industry, including the 2009 uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons from the Montara Wellhead Platform in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor_Sea" rel="nofollow">
         Timor Sea
        </a>
        , the 2010 Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico, and the 2012 fatalities at the Stena Clyde rig in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Strait" rel="nofollow">
         Bass Strait
        </a>
        , it is vital that necessary improvements to strengthen the offshore petroleum regulatory regime are made as soon possible. The amendments in this Bill implement the lessons learned from these incidents, including through measures to implement the Australian Government's Response to the
        <i>
         Report of the
        </i>
        <i>
         Montara Commission of Inquiry
        </i>
        , in order to improve protection for human health and safety and the marine environment. If the Bill is not considered in one Parliamentary sitting period, these necessary amendments to strengthen the regulatory regime and improve protections for human health and safety and the marine environment, will be delayed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The measure to clarify the application of the "polluter pays" principle in the OPGGSA will ensure, in the event of an escape of petroleum during offshore petroleum operations, that the polluter will be responsible for paying associated costs of clean-up, environmental remediation and monitoring. Under current arrangements in the absence of a statutory obligation and cost-recovery mechanism, which will continue if the Bill is not dealt with in this sitting period, in the event of an oil spill there is a risk that the Government would have to meet any shortfall if the polluter is unwilling or unable to pay those costs, which could be quite significant.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the amendments to enable NOPSEMA inspectors to issue environmental prohibition notices and improvements notices to titleholders will ensure there is an appropriate administrative process in place to require timely action to remove threats to the environment from offshore petroleum activities. Similar notices have been used successfully to require the removal of threats to occupational health and safety for a number of years. If the Bill is not dealt with in these sittings, the availability of this important regulatory tool for NOPSEMA will be delayed.

        I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:

        Disability C are Australia Fund Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of this bill is to establish the DisabilityCare Australia Fund (the Fund). The Fund is to be established for holding and investing the additional Medicare levy proceeds for the purpose of reimbursing the Commonwealth and States for expenditure under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        ). The Fund will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians (the Board). The Board will only be able to invest in financial assets in line with the arrangements for the Nation-building Funds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will also provide the opportunity to include interim matters to enable the NDIS to commence from 1 July 2013, through creation of a transitional special account to manage
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Government" rel="nofollow">
         State Government
        </a>
        funds until the Board oversighting the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency is established. The transitional special account should also be credited with the Commonwealth's contribution for 2013-14 which will be appropriated to the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. This would provide assurance to State Governments that the Commonwealth's contribution will only be spent on the NDIS.

       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill requires passage in the 2013 Winter sitting to provide certainty to the disability sector in Australia that the NDIS will be funded in a transparent manner and that those funds allocated will be used solely for the purpose of funding the NDIS.

        Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Inbound Cargo Security Enhancement) Bill 2013
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill amends the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 (the Act) to allow the Minister responsible for the Act to prohibit the carriage of certain cargo into Australian territory on an aircraft through the use of a disallowable instrument.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Threats to aviation security present an ongoing risk to planes and passengers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the current mechanisms such as Special Security Declarations provide an immediate response capacity to specific threats involving the air cargo system, the limited period of validity (six months) means that they are not an appropriate mitigation to threats which remain in place beyond the immediate term.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amending Transport Security Programs provides a longer term effect, but the mechanism is cumbersome in nature and not suited to a timely or consistent response in the interests of national security. It requires significant resources and time to accomplish, and creates a significant administrative burden for the Government and industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will provide the Government with a more timely, effective and transparent mechanism to respond to aviation security threats involving inbound air cargo while reducing the administrative burden on industry and government. Where a threat must be addressed in this manner, it will enable decision-making to be taken at a ministerial level and allow for oversight by the Parliament. In cases where potentially sensitive security and trade decisions must be made, this is a more appropriate and transparent decision-making process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In an enduring risk environment where both industry and government need to do more with less, the introduction of a more timely, effective and transparent mechanism and the reduction of administrative burdens are reasons why this bill is one which should be prioritised by this Parliament.
       </p>

        The Bill introduces or amends several requirements which commence on 1 July 2013. A number of key regulations associated with these provisions will need to be made before that date if superannuation funds are to meet their obligations under the legislation. The Bill must have
