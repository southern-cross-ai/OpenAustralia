        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health. I refer the minister to her intervention causing the removal of the Health Star Rating website just hours after it went live. Can the minister explain why the website was removed without consultation with members of the Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation? Now that the conflict of interest in her office has been revealed, will the minister do the right thing and put the website back up?

         In relation to the final part of the senator's question, there is no conflict of interest. In relation to the first part of the question, I clearly outlined to the Senate last week my reasons; I will do so again. My belief was that the website's going live was premature for three reasons. Firstly, the Health Star Rating system has not yet commenced on supermarket shelves. It would have been very confusing for consumers to go into a supermarket and realise that no star rating was on the front of packs as yet. Secondly, the forum took a unanimous decision to have an extensive cost-benefit analysis done that was due to report back to the forum in June this year. It was premature to have the website live until this report was completed. Thirdly, the Front-of-Pack Labelling Oversight and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Advisory Committee
         </a>
         was charged at the December meeting with advising the forum on processes for dealing with anomalies that still exist in the system and that advice has not yet been given to the forum. The website indicated, at the foot of the website, that it was the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Commonwealth of Australia
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         I based my decision to direct that the website be taken down on all of those issues. The issue around the placing of the website should correctly be a decision of the forum. There was no decision in the communique put out by the forum relating to the website going live at the December meeting.

                   Order! Those interjections are disorderly. I ask for silence on my right, just as I ask for silence when the minister is giving the answer.

                    Will the Health Star Rating systems be implemented from June 2014, as planned by the Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation? Can the minister assure the Senate that she will not allow conflicts of interest to further inhibit or delay the implementation of the system?

                       There is no conflict of interest so it will not impede the front-of-pack labelling process. In relation to the first part of the question, the senator knows that the target is indeed June 2014 and that target date remains. The senator is also aware that it is a voluntary system that will be put in place by industry and it is up to industry to meet that target date.
