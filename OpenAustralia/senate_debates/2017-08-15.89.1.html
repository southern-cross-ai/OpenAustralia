         I would like to thank Senator O'Sullivan and acknowledge his longstanding interest in this area, particularly in his state of Queensland. Because economic development is at the heart of this government's partnership with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         , Indigenous Australians must be at the forefront of development opportunities if we're going to build wealth and prosperity that we need to improve the outcome of our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          First Australians
         </a>
         . We are delivering across a range of programs. We're investing in businesses to build local economies and communities across regional and remote Australia—places like Aurukun and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Isa" rel="nofollow">
          Mount Isa
         </a>
         , in the senator's home state. We on this side understand that the needs of Indigenous businesses differ between the cities and the bush.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've established a $90 million Indigenous Entrepreneurs Fund to help Indigenous businesses get a foot in the door. Under this fund, there are principally two types of support: a business advisory support and grants for plant and equipment. By investing in today's Indigenous businesses and entrepreneurs, our government is fostering a generation of entrepreneurs who will build their own business knowledge, their own assets and their own wealth. Most importantly, Indigenous businesses will employ the next generation of Indigenous workers.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to also acknowledge the words of my colleague Senator Dodson, who said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We need to recognise that the best way of dealing with problems is with respect, working together, and focussed on commonly agreed goals.
        </p>
        <p>
         We on this side are working hard to get Indigenous jobseekers in a position to support engagement and to support employment in remote communities. Through our Community Development Program, we have supported 15,000 jobs that have actually been real jobs, away from a Work for the Dole program. Over 5,000 of these have been there now for over six months. And can I report that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDP" rel="nofollow">
          CDP
         </a>
         in Galiwinku has now trained jobseekers in construction of their own houses and they're transitioning into full-time employment.

            We know that the best way to guarantee success is to work in close partnership with our
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Australians" rel="nofollow">
             First Australians
            </a>
            to promote economic development in their own communities. Earlier this month, I was lucky enough to be on Gumatj country in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
             Northern Territory
            </a>
            and saw the outstanding success of the Gumatj corporation in growing wealth and generating jobs for their people. It was a great occasion to be at Garma with the Prime Minister and to witness the Gumatj corporation sign off on their own mining agreement. This is on top of a coffee shop, a nursery, a sawmill, a furniture factory, a cattle enterprise, a butcher shop and a fishing enterprise. They're now going into mining on their own country. The government has made it possible, with an investment of $800,000, to establish a mine training centre. And, again, on the Gumatj corporation's advice, they built the entire mine training centre, which is really value adding.

We're investing for the first time in native title holders, with a $20 million fund to ensure that the prescribed body corporate can act in a way that is not a David-and-Goliath arrangement—that they actually have the capacity to have legal services and other services to ensure that those negotiations are fair and equal.
