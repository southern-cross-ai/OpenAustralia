       <p class="italic">
        Medical Research Future Fund (

        Clinical Trial Activity
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The current focus of the MRFF clinical trial investment program is rare cancer, rare diseases and unmet need and provides $219 million over six years to stimulate efforts to find cures and transformative new drugs and treatments for those impacted by devastating conditions, including low survival cancers. This investment in activity also serves to build capacity to position Australia as a preferred destination for clinical trials.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To date $36.6 million has been announced for clinical trial activity under the MRFF addressing rare cancers, rare diseases and unmet need. This includes $10 million specifically for clinical trials targeting cancers and diseases with low survival rates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Applications for the recent $33 million grant round are being assessed and outcomes will be announced in due course.

       <p class="italic">
        Cancer Australia
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Cancer Australia was established by the Australian Government in 2006 to benefit all Australians affected by cancer, and their families and carers. Cancer Australia's purpose is to minimise the impact of cancer, address disparities, and improve the health outcomes of people affected by cancer in Australia by providing national leadership in cancer control.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Cancer Australia leads a national and collaborative approach to supporting cancer research including in low survival and low incidence cancers through the Priority- driven Collaborative Cancer Research Scheme (PdCCRS) and Support for Cancer Clinical Trials program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The PdCCRS provides a dedicated and coordinated pool of funding for cancer research from government and other funders to maximise the number of cancer research grants funded in Australia. PdCCRS is priority driven, using an evidence- based approach to determine research. These priorities include the provision of funding for research focused on populations with poorer cancer outcomes – such as those diagnosed with low survival rate cancers. Under the PdCCRS 2007-2017 funding rounds, more than $25 million has been awarded to 72 research projects for cancers with low survival rates. The 2018 and 2019 rounds of the PdCCRS include a dedicated funding stream for children's cancers of low survival that will provide up to $3.26 million to support research.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Support for Cancer Clinical Trials program leads a national and collaborative approach to growing Australia's capacity to develop industry-independent cancer clinical trials protocols. Since 2008, Cancer Australia has provided more than $80 million in funding to Australia's 14 multi-site Collaborative Cancer Clinical Trials Groups and a further $13.7 million to six National Technical Services to support the Collaborative Clinical Trials Groups in the development of new industry independent trial protocols including for cancers with low survival rates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, in 2013 Cancer Australia established and funded the Genomic Cancer Clinical Trial Initiative. The initiative recognises the importance of genomics and enables the collaborative development of mutation-specific clinical trial protocols for mutations that are common across several tumour types. The initiative has supported the development of 20 new clinical trials concepts, including concepts for trials in cancers of low survival rates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the 2017-18 Budget under the Investing in Medical Research – Fighting childhood cancer initiative, Cancer Australia received $5.8 million over four years to increase Australia's research capacity to advance diagnosis, treatment, management and analysis of childhood cancer, and improve data and awareness of childhood cancer. The measure also saw the establishment of a specific funding stream for low survival childhood cancers through the PdCCRS. Of the $5.8 million, $1.4 million is to fast track international collaborations for research into paediatric brain cancer in Australia, including the Access to Innovative Molecular diagnostic Profiling for paediatric brain tumours (

        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation is noted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        NHMRC's strategic priorities, as set out in the Corporate Plan, are based on health system needs, evidence gaps, advice from the Council of NHMRC and government policies, including the National Health Priority Areas (

        Major Health Issues such as Low Survival Rate Cancers will be taken into consideration in the development of NHMRC's annual work plan as part of the Corporate Plan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2.164 The committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council introduces the option for extensions to the duration of funding to recipients of research grants, provided that these recipients satisfy certain performance criteria.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation is noted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The NHMRC has reviewed the structure of its research funding as part of the Structural Review of NHMRC's Grant Program and based on feedback sought from the research sector developed a new grant program that is currently being implemented. Applications for funding under NHMRC's new grant program will open in late 2018-early 2019 for peer review in 2019, and funding commencing in 2020.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the new grant program all Investigator Grants will be for five years duration and include a research support package which allows for longer term projects and more research funding than was previously provided. Synergy Grants will also be for five years and Ideas Grants will be for up to five years. Collectively these three funding schemes will account for about 70 per cent of NHMRC's research expenditure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        NHMRC is considering its peer review processes in 2018 and the option to extend grant funding or streamline new applications that are linked to an existing grant may be considered as part of this process.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p>
        3.85 The committee recommends that the Australian government improves AustralianClinicalTrials.gov.au so it is more accessible and user-friendly.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ANZCTR is also part of the worldwide initiative to make public all clinical trials being conducted. Trial registration through ANZCTR has the potential to improve research transparency, facilitate trial participation, avoid research duplication, identify research gaps, and promote collaboration. Improving information on ANZCTR would directly benefit consumers searching for trials on AustralianClincialTrials.gov.au.

       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation is supported in principle, noting that not all responsibilities for the conduct of clinical trials rest with governments. In particular, costs associated with specific clinical trials are a matter for sites and sponsors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has committed $261 million over the six years from 2016-17 under the MRFF to support new clinical trial activity with a focus on rare and low survival cancers and diseases, and international collaboration. A total of $36.6 million in funding has already been announced, with $10 million specifically targeting low survival cancers and diseases. These clinical trials will be undertaken in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia has a reputation for excellence in clinical trial research, internationally recognised researchers and medical experts, quality infrastructure and high standards of healthcare. In Australia, clinical trials are conducted within a strong regulatory framework determined by the International Conference on Harmonisation (

The aim is to establish state-based central hubs or coordinating units to fast track trial recruitment and start up. These hubs/units will make it easier for domestic and international sponsors and researchers to establish and run trials and for patients to participate. The initiative is supported by the COAG Health Council's revitalised clinical trials agenda that recognises that patients are at the centre of clinical trials and clinical trials are essential health system activities.

        ) methodologies used are consistent, transparent and incorporate international best practice. The revision provided an opportunity to address matters such as clinical evidence needs, handling the consequences of allowing cross-over in cancer medicine trials and the use of surrogate outcomes to estimate the overall effectiveness of new medicines. The revised Guidelines have enhanced assessment processes for cancer medicines for timely inclusion on the PBS.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government and Medicines Australia signed a Strategic Agreement in April 2017 under which they undertook to work together to improve timeliness, transparency and efficiency in PBS listing processes. This work will assist in improving PBS listing times for innovative cancer medicines recommended by the PBAC.

        In response to the recommendations of the Review of Medicines and Medical Device Regulation (MMDR Review) and as part of ongoing business improvements, the TGA has recently delivered several reforms which are likely to contribute to the timely registration of medicines for low survival rate cancers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 1 July 2017, the TGA implemented a Priority review pathway for the registration of prescription medicines. The Priority review pathway involves faster assessment of vital and life-saving prescription medicines. The target timeframe of 150 working days is up to three months shorter than the standard prescription medicines registration process which is 220 days. As at 15 October 2018, seventeen prescription medicines have received priority determination since launch of the pathway, of which eleven were for use in oncology.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Changes to the Orphan Drug Program also commenced on 1 July 2017. The Orphan Drug Program provides an incentive to lodge an application for registration of eligible medicines by waiving the associated fees. One of the new eligibility criteria provides a more generous orphan disease prevalence threshold (fewer than five in 10,000), potentially allowing additional conditions to classify as Orphan on the basis that they are recognised as distinct conditions. Since the change five medicines for use in oncology have been designated as orphan through this scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 20th March 2018, a provisional registration pathway was implemented to allow sponsors to seek time-limited provisional registration of certain prescription medicines on the basis of preliminary clinical data. This pathway allows medicines to be registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) up to two years earlier than under the standard prescription medicines registration process but are evaluated under the same milestones and evaluation time as for standard prescription medicines of 220 working days. Provisional registration of prescription medicines is limited to two years but up to two extensions of two years can be applied for by the sponsor resulting in provisional registration for a maximum of six years. As at 15 October 2018, five prescription medicines had received provisional determination since launch of the new pathway, of which five are for use in oncology.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 16
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5.126 The committee recommends that the Australian government ensures funding is available to researchers investigating whether existing drugs may be suitable for treating low survival rate cancers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation is supported, noting that the Australian Government has a number of existing research funding schemes via the NHMRC, Cancer Australia and the MRFF that provide opportunities for research into repurposed drugs to tackle low survival cancer.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 17
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5.128 The committee recommends that the Australian government works with industry to consider a mechanism to repurpose drugs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation is supported in principle, noting that through the $1.3 billion National Health and Medical Industry Growth Plan the Australian Government is seeking to collaborate with industry on a number of fronts, including exploring opportunities to access libraries of drugs for further research.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The TGA does have various mechanisms to encourage sponsors to make timely applications for low survival cancers by making the registration process faster and/or easier such as: the expedited pathways, Orphan drug program, literature based submissions and the Comparable Overseas Regulator report-based process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, the TGA is not able to compel a company to apply to register a medicine in Australia, and approval for marketing in Australia cannot be given in the absence of an application. In the past, the TGA has occasionally approached sponsors to request that an application to extend the indications of a registered medicine be lodged with the TGA to address known off-label use. For example, the TGA worked with a sponsor to facilitate an application and subsequently approval of tamoxifen for primary reduction of breast cancer risk in women who are in the moderate or high risk category.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 18
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5.131 The committee recommends that the Australian government considers a mechanism to permit access to and properly supervise use of off-label drugs for low survival rate cancer patients without further treatment options, on compassionate grounds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation is noted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Prescribing a registered medicine for indications other than the approved indications is what is commonly referred to as off-label prescribing. Off-label prescribing is a clinical decision made between the prescriber and their patient based on the risks and benefits of the use of the medicine in those individual circumstances. Off-label use should always occur in the setting of informed consent. TGA does not regulate clinical practice.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the case of prescribing unapproved medicines, the TGA administers a number of schemes to enable prescribers to access these for their patients. These include the Special Access Scheme and Authorised Prescriber Scheme. Doctors who access unapproved medicines through these pathways must do so in the setting of informed consent and in accordance with the Medical Board of Australia's code of conduct, Good Medical Practice.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 19
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5.133 The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration and Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee examine the appropriateness of their approval and assessment processes for existing drugs repurposed for use in low survival rate cancers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation is supported.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2017, the Minister for Health requested the PBAC Chair to find options within the Committee's scope (as per current legislation) for mechanisms to consider medicines to treat rare conditions. The PBAC Chair is currently progressing this request with the Department and other key stakeholders. As part of this consideration, the committee has requested further work be conducted, and this work is continuing. The advice from the PBAC on this matter will also feed into the broader reforms to PBAC processes being developed with the pharmaceutical industry in response to commitments given in the Australian Government's Strategic Agreement with Medicines Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As noted in the responses to Recommendations 15 and 17 above, the new expedited pathways and Orphan drug program reforms, literature-based submissions and the use of reports from comparable overseas regulators are likely to contribute towards more timely assessment and approval of medicines repurposed for use in low survival rate cancers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 20
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5.136 The committee recommends that the Australian government considers whether the Medical Services Advisory Committee and Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee processes can be streamlined where a diagnostic test and treatment for a low survival rate cancer are co-dependent.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation is supported.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department, together with MSAC and the PBAC, has developed an assessment process for ensuring integrated and streamlined consideration of co-dependent applications, including where a pathology test and a medicinal treatment are co- dependent. This type of application allows MSAC to consider the test and the PBAC to consider the medicine through a parallel assessment process, to maximise alignment of timelines and outcomes. This uses a time schedule that results in coordinated advice being provided to the Minister for Health by the two committees within three weeks of each other.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since 2011, about 30 co-dependent technology applications have been assessed through this coordinated assessment approach involving MSAC and the PBAC. In addition, through a coordinated process, the 2016 PBAC Guidelines and 2016 MSAC Investigative Guidelines updated the published guidance on these arrangements. The Department operates in an environment of continuous improvement, and a planned review of the MSAC Guidelines (and associated co-dependent processes) is anticipated to commence in 2019. The emphasis will be on process efficiencies for applicants, and timely access to treatments for Australian patients.

        Recommendation 21
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5.176 The committee recommends that the Australian government, in conjunction with its state and territory counterparts, works to improve access to specialist cancer care co-ordinators or nurses for low survival rate cancer patients in every state and territory.

       <p class="italic">
        Response:

        Recommendation 23
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5.181 The committee recommends that the Australian government further simplifies and streamlines the application process for low survival rate cancer patients and their carers when seeking to access the Disability Support Pension, or carer allowance or payment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation is noted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government considers the current Disability Support Pension (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSP" rel="nofollow">
         DSP
        </a>
        ) application process for people with low survival rate cancers is already sufficiently streamlined. Similarly, the current application process for carer payments (Carer Payment and Carer Allowance) provides an abridged and more simplified process for those who are caring for someone with a terminal illness.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In certain circumstances a claim for DSP can be granted manifestly. This means that on the basis of medical evidence alone the person is considered eligible for DSP without the need for a Job Capacity Assessment (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JCA" rel="nofollow">
         JCA
        </a>
        ) or a Disability Medical Assessment, subject to meeting all other eligibility criteria. Of particular relevance for people with cancer, DSP may be granted manifestly where a person has a terminal illness with a life expectancy of less than two years or a condition requiring a nursing home level of care. Manifest qualification is accepted if medical evidence indicates the claimant's current medical condition is chronic and debilitating with a prognosis that the condition is terminal, the average life expectancy of a patient with this condition is 24 months or less, and there is a significant reduction in work capacity within this period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A claimant who has evidence that they are a long term patient of a hospital or nursing home, or require nursing home level care (or equivalent) because of illness or infirmity and are unlikely to be discharged in the foreseeable future, is accepted as manifestly qualified for DSP. The medical evidence needs to provide details of: the nature of the impairment and reason for long term hospitalisation; the likelihood of discharge; and ability to perform activities of daily living.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Two lists of conditions are available in the
        <i>
         Guide to Social Security Law
        </i>
        to help Centrelink decision makers determine manifest eligibility for DSP on the grounds of terminal illness, nursing home level care requirements, and/or intellectual disability. It is important to note that the lists supplement, rather than replace manifest guidelines. Therefore manifest grants can still be made for claimants with conditions that are not listed, that is any condition, including cancer, that meets the terminal illness or people requiring a nursing home level of care categories detailed above.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        List 1 catalogues conditions which are accepted as manifest (clearly and obviously meet all the DSP qualification criteria) on diagnosis alone. If the condition listed in the DSP claimant's medical evidence is on this list eligibility will be established without the need for a JCA allowing more timely granting of payment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The second list of conditions includes those which may upon some further investigation, be manifest on the grounds of terminal illness, nursing home level care requirements, or intellectual disability. The Centrelink decision maker will obtain on the spot advice about the condition, treatment regime and likely prognosis by contacting the treating doctor and/or the Centrelink Heath Professional Advisory Unit (HPAU). The treating doctor or the HPAU may be able to confirm the expected prognosis, including whether terminal, or would necessitate nursing home level care, or indicates a manifest intellectual disability, and thereby expedite the claim as manifest without a JCA.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To receive Carer Payment and/or Carer Allowance, carers of an adult (over 16 years) are assessed under the Adult Disability Assessment Tool (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADAT" rel="nofollow">
         ADAT
        </a>
        ), while carers of children (under 16 years) have their care assessed under the Disability Care Load Assessment (DCLA). Both tools contain provisions that streamline the claim process for carers of an adult or child who has a terminal illness, although the provisions differ between adult and child qualification. As the payments target assistance to carers it is necessary to establish the level of care provided to determine payment qualification, and the questions on the claim forms are designed to assess care provision across a broad range of medical conditions and disabilities, including those with a terminal illness such as cancer.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For carers of an adult where the treating health professional indicates the care receiver is in the final stage of a terminal illness and is not expected to survive for more than 3 months, the medical component of the Carer Payment or Carer Allowance claim form is significantly abridged. The carer is required to complete the carer questionnaire to determine that a qualifying level of care is being provided.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Qualification for Carer Allowance for a child diagnosed with a terminal condition may be fast tracked through the
        <i>
         List of Recognised Disabilities
        </i>
        – a List that includes certain disabilities or conditions that are consistently severe enough to qualify the parent or carer for the allowance automatically. If the child's disability or condition is not on the List the DCLA is used to determine payment eligibility, and the carer must complete the care needs assessment form to establish qualification.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An abridged process exists for carers of a child with a terminal condition when claiming Carer Payment. If the medical practitioner certifies that the average life expectancy for a child with the same or similar condition is not substantially longer than 24 months, and the child will need personal care for a significant period every day for the duration of the condition, the carer qualifies for payment without completing the care needs assessment form. Carer Allowance is also automatically granted. These terminal child provisions also allow the carer to remain qualified for payment until the child turns 18, rather than having to apply for Carer Payment and/or Carer Allowance under the adult assessment process.'
