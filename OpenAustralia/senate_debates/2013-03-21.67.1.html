         Tertiary Education

        , Skills, Science and Research, Senator Lundy. I refer the minister to revelations that the government plans to cut its education counsellor posts in Thailand, Taiwan,

         Hong Kong

        and Singapore, who all play an integral role in promoting Australia's $15 billion per year international education industry. Given the government's decision comes after already presiding over a $2½ billion decline in Australia's international education industry since 2009, why is the government causing even further damage to one of Australia's largest service export industries?

         The international education sector in Australia has faced significant challenges over the past four years. The government has responded with a major program of reforms for the sector, including the Baird and Knight reviews. These reforms have strengthened the quality of the international education, increased the integrity of the student visa program and improved the competitiveness of the sector. Since the government announced its response to the strategic review of the student visa program back in September 2011, 22 of the 41 recommendations have been implemented. This has included streamlined visa processing arrangements for universities, the introduction of the genuine temporary entrance requirements, reducing financial requirements for high-risk applicants and the establishment of education visa consultative committees. The government is currently giving high priority to developing its response to the assessment level framework review and an announcement is expected shortly. The government will also introduce poststudy work arrangements for eligible graduates of bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees.

             last week, Mr James Packer said that the government can and must do more in China and Asia to promote Australia's international education industry? He called on the government to have the courage to deliver on the Asian century white paper by putting its words into action. Can the minister explain why the only international education roadshow for 2013 scheduled by Austrade, the organisation in charge of the promotion of Australia's international education industry, is just in Fiji?

              The government are committed to supporting Australian students undertaking study experiences in Asia and we have committed $37 million to the AsiaBound Grants Program for students undertaking short or semester length study opportunities for Asian languages. Unlike the opposition, who have threatened to cull the AsiaBound program, we recognise the need for not only more Australians to study in Asia but greater opportunity to build that experience around culture and develop skills and friendships as per the Asian century white paper. In fact, in October last year we announced some $37 million for the AsiaBound Grants Program, which provided funding in the form of $2,000 or $5,000 grants for Australian students undertaking study experiences in Asia for up to 12 months. The funding to commence in the financial year of 2013-14 will support travel and living.

                  ? This is despite recommendations in the Chaney report for the government to increase and coordinate the promotion of Australia's international education industry in those regions. How can anyone possibly trust this short-sighted government to reverse the decline of the Australian international education industry?
