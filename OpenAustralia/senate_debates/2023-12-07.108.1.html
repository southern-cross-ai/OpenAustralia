          My question is to the Minister for Finance. Minister Gallagher, we meet again! Minister, your recent social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter, claimed that digital
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID" rel="nofollow">
           ID
          </a>
          s are not compulsory. That post was labelled as 'potentially misleading'. Minister, did you mislead the Australian public? Can your digital ID be compulsory, or are the fact checkers perhaps wrong on this one?

          <p>
           I thank Senator Babet for the question. Just for the record, we don't meet often! At all! I haven't seen the post that he refers to. But the digital
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID" rel="nofollow">
            ID
           </a>
           legislation makes it clear that the digital ID is voluntary for individuals accessing government services. The legislation makes that clear.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have also been on the record saying that for businesses it is a requirement to use myGovID for certain engagements with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
            ATO
           </a>
           , and that is for security reasons and to minimise the risk of fraud relating to businesses and their transactions with the ATO. But the legislation is very clear that digital ID is voluntary and that options for individuals to access government services must be maintained for those who choose not to have a digital ID.
          </p>
          <p>
           But the idea behind a digital ID is to improve security for personal information, and we know that Australians are very worried. About three-quarters of Australians are worried about theft of identity, cybercrime, scams et cetera, and this is a really important way of reducing the risk by reducing the amount of personal information that's required to rent a house, to engage with government at times and to engage with the private sector as well. It's about reducing it and allowing the person to control that verification of their identity.

             The bill does indeed state that the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID" rel="nofollow">
              ID
             </a>
             is voluntary, but with multiple exceptions. Section 74, as you would know, grants the regulator the power to compel the use of digital ID if they are satisfied that it is appropriate to do so. Is that true? Does the bill grant the regulator the capacity to mandate digital ID if they deem it appropriate to do so?

              I think this goes to the point I've just made about the fact that digital
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID" rel="nofollow">
               ID
              </a>
              is required for businesses engaging with, say, the

               ATO
              </a>
              at the moment—or a director's ID to minimise the risk of fraud. But, in relation to a person, creating or not creating a digital ID for themselves for their personal engagement with government remains voluntary. In fact, the bill states that government services—because of course we can't mandate in the private sector—must maintain an option—

                   Minister, in the 1980s your party proposed the

                   . A Labor Party backbencher at the time,

                   , said the card was un-Australian and should be more appropriately called the 'Hitler card' or the 'Stalin card'. Many have compared your party's digital

                   to the Australia Card. Minister, how will you ensure the centralisation of ID federally will not be misused by any future governments?

                    I don't think Senator Canavan understands what it actually is. It's about verifying your identity through your own control of the information that you share online to access services. Senator Babet, you are a business owner, a real estate agent. You would know, from dealing with rental properties and things, the amount of information you have to collect to verify potential tenants. This has the opportunity and the potential to significantly reduce the information that you, as a business holder, would hold in your own records about individuals that may rent properties off you. That protects you as a business owner, and it protects tenants of those rental properties.
