         I thank Senator Canavan for his question, and for understanding the huge importance of the resources sector in Australia, but particularly up your way in Rockhampton in that economy. The government of which we are members, the Morrison-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCormack" rel="nofollow">
          McCormack
         </a>
         government, understands how extraordinarily important the resources sector is and the role that it plays in creating jobs and investment in Australia, particularly in regional Australia. The sector is an absolutely key pillar of our economic prosperity, and it will be absolutely crucial in ensuring that Australia's economic recovery is strong. In fact, in August this year, the resources industry was employing over 247,000 Australians. That's an increase of more than 6,000 since February. We know the importance of giving regional Australia the best opportunity, and we will continue to back the resources sector as one of the largest and most important employers in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Even in the midst of this once-in-a-century event, the largest economic shock in 100 years, this sector continues to support regional communities and provides great support and commitment to the training of new workers, with some 8½ thousand new workers having been recently trained. The latest report,
         <i>
          Resources and energy major projects: 2020
         </i>
         report, identified a really bright future for many of our major resources and energy projects, including a 19 per cent increase from last year in a number of major resources and energy projects under development currently in Australia. These 335 projects have a value of $334 billion.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Prime Minister said, our focus right now is protecting Australia's health, securing jobs and livelihoods, and setting Australia up to make sure that we are stronger when the coronavirus is over.

            Whether it be gas, whether it be iron ore or whether it be critical minerals, our resources industries continue to invest in our economy, bringing jobs and long-term security to regional Australia and regional Australians. The recent
            <i>
             Resources and energy major projects: 2020
            </i>
            report identified the broad spread of opportunities that exist in resources investment across Australia, including in Queensland and the

             Northern Territory
            </a>
            . As you're probably aware, Senator Canavan, in Queensland alone there are more than 50 projects generating billions and billions of dollars for the Queensland and the Australian economy.
           </p>
           <p>
            As well as the projects in Senator Canavan's home state, yesterday the minister for resources announced that we're helping to fast track a $1.5 billion project to mine phosphate in Senator McMahon's home state of the Northern Territory. This project, which is 200 kilometres from

                The one thing I can absolutely assure you of, Senator Canavan, is that this government, the government of which you and I are members, remains absolutely committed to supporting the resources sector in this country. That's why, in the 2020-21 budget, the Morrison-
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCormack" rel="nofollow">
                 McCormack
                </a>
                government invested $125 million to extend the Exploring for the Future program for another four years. And there was $52.9 million for the Gas-fired Recovery package. This investment is absolutely crucial for Australia's economy, especially now that our internal borders are starting to open up. These measures attract investment, they deliver jobs and they secure a reliable, low-cost energy pipeline for manufacturers, industries and households.
               </p>
               <p>
                Senator Canavan, I know that you've been a very vocal supporter of the expansion of the New Acland mine in the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Downs" rel="nofollow">
                 Darling Downs
                </a>
                . It was really disappointing that we've been waiting several years for its approval by the Queensland government. Investing in mining is a great opportunity for this country.
