        This bill will clearly contribute to the ongoing security measures we have as part of our transport system. I think, clearly, there are a number of measures in this bill which will enhance those operations and ensure that we have the security processes in place that we need in our aviation sector.

         As set out in the circulated amendments, on behalf of Pauline Hanson's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
          One Nation
         </a>
         , our proposed changes to the Transport Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 will refocus security screening from its current deference to political correctness to the single goal of minimising risk to air travellers by responding to identified threats. Specifically, our amendments to the bill before the Senate seek, firstly, to delete the word 'random' from regulation 3.16D(4) of the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005; and, secondly, to add a subsection (6) to section 41 in part 4 of division 2 of the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to state:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Screening of individuals is to be conducted in accordance with the advice of the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, in general prioritising individuals profiled as members of high threat groups.
        </p>
        <p>
         Currently, airport screening is to be conducted not in accordance with the threat advice of the Australian Federal Police and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
          ASIO
         </a>
         but on a non-discriminatory, random basis. This ridiculous situation subordinates screening of the highest risk individuals to the political correct goal of being nondiscriminatory. In other words, this places politically correct ahead of the safety and security of Australian families. This left-wing control madness must end. These proposed amendments will remove the requirement in the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005 for security screening to be conducted randomly and then amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to require that screening of individuals be conducted whilst prioritising individuals profiled as members of high-threat groups in accordance with the advice of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         and ASIO.
        </p>
        <p>
         One Nation implores other senators to put the safety of our loved ones first and support our efforts to align our security procedures with those of the Israelis and the Americans, for whom airport security is a non-negotiable priority. In that spirit I commend One Nation's amendments to the chamber.

As the minister in the other place said and as I stated here this morning, aviation workers who are subject to security screening under the new arrangements will be afforded the same protections as passengers to ensure that they are not subject to racial or religious discrimination and that their privacy is protected. The bill will provide airports with the flexibility to determine the best way to implement security-screening controls for the airside areas and submit their transport security plan to the Office of Transport Security for approval. The bill will also ensure that Australia is meeting its requirements under the

           I wish to advise Senator Roberts that the opposition will not be supporting these amendments. We believe they would allow racial profiling, pure and simple, an approach that law enforcement and national security organisations, both here and overseas, including the United States, are opposed to. When the police and national security agencies start targeting people based on their race it effectively puts a whole community under suspicion. What is more, it virtually guarantees that the innocent will regularly find themselves stopped for little reason beyond the colour of their skin. Racial profiling can also poison relations between authorities and the community. When minority groups feel they are under constant suspicion they are less likely to pass on information that could be vital to solving crimes and, more importantly, preventing terrorist attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lastly, as the bill's explanatory memorandum quite rightly states:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           All people have the right to be treated equally. In keeping with Australia’s egalitarian screening regime applied to aviation passengers, selection of airport and airline workers, visitors and contractors for screening inside the security restricted areas … of airports will be conducted on a purely random basis. Individuals will not be selected according to their race, religion, gender, or any other personal characteristic.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is the kind of Australia that the Labor Party wishes to continue to stand up for.

            are also opposed to Senator Roberts's amendments. We completely reject the hurtful, hateful racism and Islamophobia contained within the proposed amendments. We know that the so-called Christian Aussie that Senator Roberts referred to as being less likely to be a terrorist is in fact just as likely to be a terrorist as any other race of people in Australia. As the Prime Minister has reinforced today, we live in the most successful multicultural nation in the world. The reason we are the most successful multicultural nation is that we respect and celebrate difference and we know that people, regardless of their background and race, are free to be law-abiding Australian citizens.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Senator Roberts's amendments were successful, everyone of Muslim background would be much more likely to be screened, regardless of there being no justification for that. We know that it would mean that people would be feeling that division. We know what breeds hatred in our community, and it is the racist, hateful and hurtful positions of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
             One Nation
            </a>
            . That is what is breeding hatred. It is, in fact, what is breeding unlawful activity in our community. We know that treating everyone equally, regardless of their background, and encouraging and supporting their sense of being valued by all Australians is what will keep us safe.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Greens want to send the message to people from all backgrounds in Australia that we consider Australians all equal here. We want to keep everybody safe and we know the way to do that is to treat everybody equally. In measures like this, where we are concerned about the safety of Australians, every Australian has the right to be treated the same and treated as equally as other Australians.
