         I thank the senator for his question. I am somewhat surprised that you would walk into a question like this. I know that you have very strong views on these questions, but you would have thought that the questions committee in the opposition would have provided you with more facts. This was a Howard government decision in 2003, which meant that Bibles and holy books were no longer considered appropriate gifts to be distributed to new citizens at citizenship ceremonies. I appreciate your interest in the matter, but you should check the facts before you walk in. I think Senator Abetz has set you up again. I think it is something to do with Tasmanian politics. It is very unfortunate and quite cruel in fact.

             The Howard government made the decision in 2003, which meant that Bibles and holy books were no longer considered appropriate gifts to be distributed to new citizens at citizenship ceremonies. So Bibles are not banned from citizenship ceremonies. Attendees may choose to bring their own bible or a holy book on which they make their citizenship pledge. We have indicated, following the decision of the Howard government, that to ensure the secular nature of the ceremony attendees can select the pledge that best suits their beliefs. One pledge may well mention God; other pledges do not. It is entirely a matter for the individual. It is not a decision that this government has taken but a decision of the Howard government. I think, Senator Abetz, you should not be so mercurial as to put a senator in a position to ask a question such as that.

              , I ask a supplementary question. Clearly the minister has not got his facts together. Does the minister agree that the giving of holy books, including Bibles, as gifts at citizenship ceremonies has been a longstanding practice in large and small communities all across Australia? Does the minister agree that this ban is political correctness gone mad?

               Senator Barnett, might I just refresh you on the facts. The opposition seems to be only too happy to grandstand on divisive issues without checking the facts. But in 1998 the version of the code under the heading ‘Holy books’ stated:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Some local governments may choose to make a gift to each new citizen of the particular holy book on which the candidate will make the Australian Citizenship Pledge.
              </p>
              <p>
               This version of the code also included ‘holy book’ under the list of appropriate gifts that may be given to citizens on page 8 of the guide. However, in 2003 under the Howard government this advice was changed to include the words:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Candidates who wish to use a holy book or scripture when making the Pledge should be invited to bring the holy book or scripture of their choice to the citizenship ceremony.
              </p>
              <p>
               That was on page 35. At the same time holy books were removed from the list of appropriate gifts which are included on page 19. So go to Senator Abetz and ask him why he set you up with such a question.

                    , I have been very clear with the senator. I have given him a very direct answer as to the circumstances for the use of Bibles at citizenship ceremonies. There is no ban on the use of holy books at citizenship ceremonies. Individuals make the choice as to whether or not they bring Bibles to those ceremonies and the source of those Bibles is not covered by any regulation whatsoever.
