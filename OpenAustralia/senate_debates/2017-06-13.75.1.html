         acknowledge the senator's tireless work for, and commitment to, regional communities. I am absolutely delighted to advise the senator that on 17 May, I released Regions 2030: Unlocking Opportunity, which sets out this coalition government's agenda for regional Australia towards 2030. The plan is recognition that our regions are absolutely critical to our nation's future and outlines the government's strong commitment to ensuring regional Australia is as strong, sustainable and prosperous as possible. The plan builds on the establishment of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Regional Australia
         </a>
         Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Prime Minister, which is aimed at making regional Australia an even better place to work, live and invest.
        </p>
        <p>
         As part of Regions 2030, we are focusing on five key areas across government. They are jobs and economic development, infrastructure, health, education and communications.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since coming to government, the coalition has been making record investments in our regions across all of these areas, whether it is in major infrastructure such as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Bruce Highway
         </a>
         , building new dams or rolling out the

          NBN
         </a>
         , or whether it is investing in local community infrastructure—such as a new kitchen for the Junction Clubhouse in Cairns, which I had the privilege of opening last Friday. We are delivering the infrastructure and services that will make regional Australia an even better place to live.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a government that has many of us sitting on this side of the chamber living in regional Australia. We understand regional Australia. We are also committed to protecting its future. Regions 2030 is our vision to see regions in Australia get the investment that they need and deserve so that we can ensure the future prosperity of the nation, which we know is built on the back of regional Australia.

           I thank the minister for that very encouraging answer and for the update. I might say, coming from the north and coming on the back of the private investment in Adani that was announced during the week, it is all very good news.

            I can advise the chamber that we have indeed already started delivering a range of measures in the five focus areas that we have prioritised. We are delivering lower taxes through the enterprise tax plan, which will benefit the 542,000 small businesses that call regional Australia home. As part of this year's budget, we are also investing $9 million so that rural and remote Australians can for the first time access psychology services covered by Medicare through teleconferencing and Skype. I acknowledge Senator Smith for the work he has been doing in this area. This year's budget also delivers $15 million for up to eight regional study hubs across regional Australia to support rural, regional and remote university students complete their studies. And, very significantly, we are investing $8.4 billion to build the inland rail. It took the coalition to deliver it, and deliver it we will.

               I am indeed aware of many alternative approaches to regional development as well as the many, many failed approaches that we have seen in the past from the Labor government. Senators opposite involved in the Labor Party played a big role in delivering terrible policy outcomes. The biggest failure, of course, was the carbon tax, that hit regional Australia harder than anywhere else, pushing up power prices.

                 What about the live export cattle ban, which saw our northern beef industry brought to its knees by the Labor Party in government? It was absolute callousness and a disregard for those people in the north and indeed right across country as a result of that stupid and failed decision by the Labor Party. Finally—and I know I have often mentioned it before,
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
                  Mr President
