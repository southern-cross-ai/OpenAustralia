        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. In the Turnbull government's submission arguing against a fair increase in the minimum wage, it argues that:
       </p>
       <p>
        Low-paid employees are often found in high-income households.
       </p>
       <p>
        In an interview with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Mitchell" rel="nofollow">
         Neil Mitchell
        </a>
        on 3AW, the minister at least five times failed to answer how many of the 200,000 people on minimum wage have a rich family to rely on. Given that she has had time to prepare, will the minister now tell the Senate how many of the 200,000 people have a rich family to rely on?

         I thank Senator Cameron for the question. In relation to the first part of his question, I completely reject what he has stated, that the government has filed a submission that does not support an increase in the minimum wage. In relation to the very selective quote that appeared on the front page of a Fairfax newspaper this morning, can I confirm that this is similar information that is provided each year by the government of the day, regardless of who is in power. For example, when you look at the submissions that were provided by the former Labor government in 2011, 2012 and 2013, each of those submissions—

           This is on relevance. The minister has answered the first part of the question. The second part of the question went to one issue: how many of the 200,000 people have a rich family to rely on? That was the question. The minister has had time to understand and prepare.

             Thank you. As I stated, this is information that is provided to the Fair Work Commission, regardless of who is in government. In relation to the question that Senator Cameron has asked, the question actually does not go to the 200,000 people who are on the minimum wage. The statistic is actually in relation to the number of low-paid employees and in relation to that, it is just under 50 per cent.

                Thank you, Senator Cameron. In relation to the annual wage review, obviously it looks at low paid and those who are on the national minimum wage regardless of gender. In relation to the actual impact on women, however, one of the points that the submission does make in relation to the gender pay gap is that because women are more likely to be on awards or on the minimum wage than men there is less likely to be a gender pay gap because they are normally paid the equivalent rate as the person they are working next to if they are a man. The point that the submission makes is if you want to look at a gender pay gap, you actually have to look further up to higher paid people.
