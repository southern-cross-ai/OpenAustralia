        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. In response to the government's decision to reject a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways" rel="nofollow">
         Qatar Airways
        </a>
        application for additional flights, the chief executive of the Australian Airports Association, James Goodwin stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Qatar situation sends a really bad signal for anyone wanting to do business in Australia. People are getting nervous now.
       </p>
       <p>
        Industry sources suggest the government's decision will cost between $540 million and $788 million annually in lessened activity. That represents thousands of job opportunities in tourism, hospitality, freight and logistics, ripped away from Australian families at a time of economic uncertainty. Minister, what economic advice did the government consider on the impact of employment across these sectors when making the Qatar Airways decision? What organisations provided that advice, and will you make that advice available to the Senate?

          I thank the senator for his question. The decision in question, from recollection, is a decision of Minister Catherine King, not of the Prime Minister. But I'm happy to take the question, notwithstanding the fact of that decision. The government is committed to continuing the growth of Australia's international air services, providing additional support and opportunities for trade and tourism, whilst maintaining a strong Australian based aviation sector. I understand that the government has decided not to approve the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority request for additional services at this time. I am also advised we have over 100 air services agreements with other countries, and we'll be seeking bilateral negotiations with other key international priority markets over the next year. When such decisions are made, obviously there are a range of factors which are considered in determining whether an expansion of bilateral air rights is in Australia's national interest. I would make the point that Senator Farrell has made, that international—

            On a point of order on a question of direct relevance, the specific matters contained in Senator Cadell's question went to the description of economic activity lost as a result of the decision, and the economic advice the government considered and received. The minister has not touched on those economic impacts at all at this stage. I ask you to draw her to the question.

                  I will continue. Coming back to the point that Senator Farrell made yesterday, international travel is recovering strongly. I know Senator Cadell talked about economic impact. I understand in the year ending January 2023 there were over 21 million passenger movements in and out of Australia. That's an increase of in excess of 1,000 per cent over the previous year, ending January 2022. We are obviously on a much better path as a consequence of the post-COVID recovery.

                    <p>
                     I don't think any minister tables anything that's gone to cabinet, but, again, I'll try to give you the courtesy of a response. The Prime Minister's focus is on the strength of the Australian economy. In the face of some challenging economic circumstances globally, we are very focused on ensuring we maximise Australia's growth and maximise the benefit to Australians of that economic growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I'm asked about international issues. Obviously, one of the reasons we have worked very hard to stabilise the relationship with China is we recognise that it is important for us to seek to have those trade impediments removed. That is of benefit to the Australian economy. In relation to the question asked, I again remind the senator that, as I understand it—and no-one has gainsaid me—under legislation this is the decision of Minister Catherine King.

As I said to you, Senator, there are obviously national interest considerations that any minister takes into account. In terms of meetings, I think anybody in this place knows that the aviation sector is not backward in coming forward in putting their views to all senators and members. I would be surprised if most people in this place, at some point, had not had a view put to them by various parts of the aviation sector. I didn't actually go to the event, but I understand—
