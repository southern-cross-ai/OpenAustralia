         I thank Senator Reynolds for her question and for her continued interest in the university sector and research. I particularly note her involvement as one of the convenors of the Parliamentary Alliance for Research and Innovation, along with Senator Dio Wang. I believe that tomorrow they will be hosting an exciting event for members and senators with the chief scientists of Israel, which I would encourage many of you to get along to.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to Senator Reynolds's question, over the forward estimates the government has committed some $10.7 billion to research in a number of areas. We will be spending some $9.7 billion across government, in 2015-16, on science, research and innovation. As part of our Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda we have outlined the strategy to improve Australia's economic performance, through better translation of research into commercial outcomes, which will be enhanced upon with the release of the innovation strategy later this year. I am proud that our government is investing more than $3 billion over four years in the highest quality research, leading to the discovery of new ideas and knowledge, through the

        <p>
         There are some incredibly exciting proposals that the ARC has supported, such as Professor Mark Kendall, an inaugural ARC Future Fellow at the

I am sure children around the country would be delighted to know he is pioneering needle-free immunisation technology that promises to eliminate the need for needles and syringes for vaccine delivery. Another is Professor Veena Sahajwalla, who is turning car tyres into steel. I had the pleasure of visiting her research facility at the University of

           The government is focused on how we translate research effort into economic outcomes, improved policy outcomes, jobs and employment opportunities for Australia. We recognise that research infrastructure is critical to this, and that is why as a government we addressed the funding cliff that was left by the previous government for the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, providing $3 million to give certainty of operation to 30 June 2017. Indeed, we are focused on making sure we address that issue for a longer term certainty in relation to NCRIS and other areas of research training.

             Through the development of our strategies and the upcoming innovation statement, this government has been undertaking a very careful process of building the pieces to make sure that our research infrastructure and our research sector are well placed to help support the Australian economy transform into the future. Back in July of this year I noticed Senator Carr was criticising the number of research reviews being undertaken by the government. But the important thing about these reviews is that they are all feeding into a process that can provide sound policy for the future. Research is an important and complex area, and it should not be run without consultation. It should not be run without analysis, which Senator Carr seems to suggest.

               These types of reviews are important inputs into the innovation statement that Prime Minister Turnbull is developing. They will be important informants of how we release and develop the innovation statement to ensure Australia's economy responds to the opportunities of the future and secures jobs and opportunities for all Australians into the future.
