        , Senator Watt. I refer to the Albanese Labor government's commitment to reform Australia's aviation sector so it delivers for the Australian economy, workers and consumers. How is the Albanese Labor government delivering on this commitment to a more competitive aviation sector while at the same time securing Australian jobs?

         Thank you very much, Senator Green. I know that, being based in Cairns, you understand the importance of a competitive aviation sector that delivers to tourists, to workers and to local economies, and finally we have a federal government prepared to deliver. I know that Senator Green, like so many on this side of the chamber, understands the importance of Australia's aviation sector to the economic prosperity of our nation and to the lives of all Australians who rely on this critical service. But, as we all know and as all of you over there in the opposition know, the previous government left the aviation policy space in tatters.

         They've had a lot to say about aviation this week, but let's not forget it was the coalition government that gave billions of taxpayer dollars to Qantas for nothing in return. It was the coalition government that stood by as Virgin collapsed into administration only for it to be snatched up by foreign private equity. It was the coalition government that over 10 years oversaw the mass outsourcing of jobs and a labour-hire mess that drove down wages and conditions across the aviation sector.

           But the list goes on. It was also the coalition government that commissioned the Harris review into
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Airport" rel="nofollow">
            Sydney Airport
           </a>
           only to spend almost two years sitting on it, leaving it to us to sort out. And it was the coalition government that cut JobKeeper from dnata workers, as some of our senators know very well, and left those families in the lurch.
          </p>
          <p>
           So today is a very important day because today the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and

           , released the aviation green paper. This is the first step in reforming and cleaning up the mess left by those opposite in our aviation sector. The aviation green paper is an important step in developing a white paper which will set the policy direction of the sector out to 2050. The government is seeking outcomes that deliver a more competitive aviation sector while at the same time securing Australian jobs. We're also looking at stronger consumer protections, improvements to complaint-handling processes and improved accessibility for consumers living with disability.

             Thank you, Minister, for that answer. I note that the Albanese Labor government is committed to an aviation sector with strong consumer protections in place. How is the Albanese Labor government looking to enhance the experience of customers in Australia's aviation sector?

             <p>
              Thank you, Senator Green. Unlike 10 years of coalition government, the Albanese government wants an aviation sector that maintains Australia's world-leading safety and security standards and provides secure jobs now and into the future. A sector needs to be reliable, competitive and affordable, supported by a robust consumer rights framework. That's why the aviation green paper—something the last coalition government never bothered to get around to—looks to stronger consumer protections, improvements to complaint-handling processes and improved accessibility for consumers living with disability. Not one of those things did the coalition deal with in its 10 years in government, for all of their road-to-Damascus conversion on matters of aviation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Through this process we're also seeking to understand whether options pursued in other jurisdictions, such as a customer rights centre, a charter or a stronger ombudsman model, would deliver benefits to Australia's aviation sector. Every Australian travelling by plane here in Australia or overseas deserves to be safe and respected, and that's why we're taking this issue seriously.

                   It's ironic that Senator McKenzie should be asking where the Harris review is, because it actually sat with the coalition for two years without any action being taken whatsoever!

                   But you're right, Senator Green. Some of us over here actually understand that access to affordable air services is a key contributor to the liveability of regional Australia, and it is essential that regional services remain viable. Aviation plays an important role in that, servicing the needs of regional and remote communities. This includes access to a range of essential services, such as health care and education. The Albanese government also recognises that now, and over the coming years, it will be critical to leverage the economic shifts underway across the world for the benefit of Australia's regions.

                   A strong regional aviation sector is critical to achieving that vision. Through this green paper process we very much want to hear directly from those Australians in regional, remote and rural communities who rely on aviation. So I would encourage all who have an interest to share their perspectives via the department's website.
