        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell. Australian exporters are struggling with the combined impact of 10 years of neglect on the world stage and the additional challenges of the pandemic. Can the minister advise how the newly announced Export Supply Chain Service will help our Australian food and beverage exporters navigate some of these challenges?

         I thank Senator Smith, one of the very many good young women on this side of the chamber, for that question. There's no doubt that some Australian exporters have done it really tough as a result of the neglect by the previous government, the worsening conditions during the pandemic as well as Russia's terrible war on the Ukraine. Exporters are critical to our economy, and they deserve a government who will stand with them and ensure that they get the support they need to thrive. To this end, last week in Brisbane, I announced the establishment of a new service to help Australian food and beverage exporters navigate global supply chains.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the biggest ongoing challenges for Australian exporters is getting their produce to international customers. Over the past few years, the freight environment has changed irreversibly. There's no doubt that the supply chains we see today are very different to the supply chains that we saw prior to the pandemic. To help these exporters navigate these complexities, the Australian government has established the Export Supply Chain Service. Under this new service, Australian exporters, state and territory governments, and industry bodies will have access to information and insights on supply chain issues. It will give Australian exporters the information and the insights that they need to inform their decision-making and navigate what have become very complex supply chain issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         Throughout the pandemic, many Australian businesses have demonstrated ingenuity and grit in response to ongoing trade disruptions. With the aid of the Australian government, they will continue to do so.

                  Well, let's talk about wine exports. You completely let down every single exporter of wine in this country, let me tell you. One of the reasons you lost this last election is you didn't understand what you were doing to Australian exporters in meat, in crayfish, in wine or in barley. None of those industries got any support from your government. But we are committed to repairing the damage that you did to this country and to those exporters, and we're going do it.

                    President, on the review of questions that you undertook earlier, I note that it was first raised in relation to questions from Senator McKenzie to Senator Watt regarding foot-and-mouth disease, and that those questions went through related issues of foot mats, vaccines and biosecurity officers. As you undertake that review I would encourage you, while noting that I believe all these questions are in order, to look equally at the question from Senator Ciccone on the same topic of foot-and-mouth disease, which went through domestic measures and then separately asked about assistance to Indonesia and the actions of the previous government. I think you will find there's a consistency there. I would contend that they are all in order.
