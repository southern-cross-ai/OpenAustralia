         I thank Senator Ruston very much for the question about the open letter that was published today from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Universities Australia
         </a>
         . All Senators will have seen that, I am sure. What Universities Australia have indicated is that they are urging the Senate to legislate the higher education reforms with amendments. They are the peak body representing Australia's universities and they say the reforms will provide the new approach to funding that is needed to maintain the quality of education that students expect and that without the reforms Australia risks being left behind. They also have television advertisements that say that, with changes, the higher education reform bill can actually give us the sustainable future that Australian universities need. What their

         It is not possible for universities to continue to deliver the quality that students and parents expect under a system that remains both financially unsustainable and uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
         They in fact call on the Senate to amend and to pass the legislation
        </p>
        <p>
         In fact, all of the higher education peak bodies in this country support the government's proposed reforms, with amendments—

            and the Group of Eight. They know that these reforms have huge benefits for their students. What the reforms mean is that present and future generations of students will actually have access to the best higher education possible in Australia. The quality of Australian higher education, the quality of the degrees offered, depends on these reforms. As well as making possible an internationally competitive higher education that students rightly expect and making this sustainable for the long-term future, of course there will be many other benefits for students.

For the first time ever, the Commonwealth will be supporting all Australian undergraduate students in all registered higher education institutions, not just in bachelor studies but in diplomas as well—all students in those courses. And tens of thousands of the sorts of students from non-university higher education providers—they were here in Canberra last week; they visited

                   This is actually a very serious question from Senator Ruston, because, if these reforms are not passed—if the opponents of the reforms continue to stand in the way of what all the higher education peak bodies agree is essential for a healthy future for higher education—they are going to be standing in the way of tens of thousands of disadvantaged students who could, for example, benefit from the

They are standing in the way of 1,500 jobs that depend on the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. They are standing in the way of the funding of the mid-career Future Fellowships for researchers. It absolutely beggars the imagination that those opposite are not interested in ensuring the future of higher education—
