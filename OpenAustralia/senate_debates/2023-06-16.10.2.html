       <p>
        Australia's enduring embrace of the arts and culture has entered a new era. Under the Albanese Labor government, a new national cultural policy named Revive will jump-start and revitalise the Australian arts, entertainment and culture scene for the next five years. This ambitious and comprehensive plan for the arts will empower homegrown talent to prosper, unlocking new job opportunities, including in my home state of Tasmania, as well as increasing engagement between local communities and the Australian artist. After a decade of coalition neglect, denial and delay of an effective arts policy, the Albanese Labor government's blueprint will revive purpose and a big-picture vision back into the arts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let's be clear. This plan will produce real-world positive results for countless hardworking Australians and their communities through investing $286 million over a four-year period in an industry that employs over 400,000 Australians and produces $17 billion for our economy. Most importantly for me, coming from Tasmania, it invests in our local economies in rural and regional areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        This visionary outlook is the centrepiece of the Creative Australia Bill, a proposed piece of legislation that rewrites governance for the arts by re-forming Creative Australia with a relevant agenda, illustrated by its corresponding plan to establish
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Music Australia
        </a>
        and Creative Workplaces.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past decades, spanning back to 1975, federal support and advice for the arts has been heralded by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Council
        </a>
        . The body performs an important duty in uplifting Australian creative arts on a domestic and international level, as well as supporting the sector with industry-leading research and advocacy on its behalf.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government is heartened to build on its long-held Labor values of supporting artists and reinforcing federal commitments to the creative industry by restoring Creative Australia in an expanded capacity. At this juncture I would just like to acknowledge the extremely hard work and leadership of Minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Burke" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Burke
        </a>
        in his consultation leading up to the last election and his ongoing hard work and commitment to this important sector. Have no doubt; this bill builds on our vision for reviving Creative Australia, reversing the harmful Brandis cuts to the arts. Establishing Music Australia and Creative Workplaces will only support and grow this vital sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Creative Australia Bill is the product of extensive consultation, as I said, on the ground, with Australian artists responding in over 1,200 submissions and authentic input from 14 town hall meetings held across the country while drafting a new national cultural policy. The two bodies under Creative Australia, Music Australia and Creative Workplaces, will perform essential duties that will keep our Revive plan for the arts on track.
       </p>
       <p>
        Music Australia will provide critical support to the Australian contemporary music scene and make room for its growth, including through establishing a strategic vision for the sector, facilitating industry collaboration, funding training and skills development, and supporting the cultural exportation of Australia art.
       </p>
       <p>
        Creative Workplaces will be the foundation of support for artists, industry workers and creative organisations in their workplaces, overseeing crucial safety standards on sets and guiding elevated matters into being appropriately addressed by the relevant mechanisms—such a stark contrast to the past decade of neglect by the previous coalition government. Further to Labor's longstanding dedication to defending workplace rights and protections in any industry, including the arts, Creative Workplaces will have the authority to set fair pay and conditions for the arts sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        Make no mistake: federal government support for creative organisations will be contingent on following these standards rigorously and upholding the labour rights of their workers, in addition to forming these long-awaited bodies that will provide direct support for the industry and assemble a blueprint for effectively implementing the Albanese Labor government's revived plan for the arts. We are committed to keeping the direction of Creative Australia on track for the long-term future of this vital sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is precisely why this bill provides for new councils to guide the work of both Music Australia and Creative Workplaces, ensuring that new services and programs are delivered effectively and with proper oversight. Our work in delivering for the arts sector, time and time again, will be done with that oversight. We will relentlessly carry out our duties in government to continue enriching Australia's vibrant, creative communities, particularly in representation of Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        cultural art. A completing bill will be introduced later this year that will complement this bill. After consultation with relevant communities we'll establish the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        and Writers Australia body within Creative Australia that aligns with the Albanese Labor government's vision for elevating Australian art.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ultimately this bill represents a continuing and ambitious commitment to significantly improve the quality of federal involvement in every aspect of the arts sector, which will unequivocally result in wide-ranging benefits for Australian artists, arts organisations and our greater community. We are doing this work now to pave the way for immediate support for jobs and quality content for this industry. Passing this bill in the winter sittings will enable Creative Australia to start its work without delay for the benefits of the arts and artists as soon as 1 July.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor's lock-step support for Australian artists under its successive governments and most recently under the Albanese Labor government could not be more important after a decade of, in contrast, deliberate neglect of the arts sector by the federal coalition. The arts sector has endured years, starting under Tony Abbott's exceptionally cruel government, of successful spending cuts and has been a victim of the delusions of grandeur under the coalition—most appallingly, when former minister

              A point of order: I was hoping that, with a gentle prompt, the good senator—a good friend of mine—would moderate the language, but in fact it went in the opposite direction. To impute that the previous minister actually made decisions based on his 'personal favourites' is an inappropriate imputation. I would ask the senator to assist the chamber by withdrawing.

                On the point of order, I think it's quite clear that Senator Polley is actually reporting the facts of what has occurred. There was an inquiry that was actually set up and voted on in this chamber, with every single other senator voting to have an inquiry. Senator Brandis had the dubious honour of having a number of inquiries set up around the arts funding.

                   Thank you. I have taken advice from the Clerk. Senator Polley, I've reminded you once already to be very mindful of the language that you are using when reflecting on previous senators who have served in this place. In assisting the chamber, it might be helpful for you to continue on with your remarks without further reflecting on those individuals.

                    actually chaired the inquiry into that matter, so if people are offended because we are actually putting some facts on the record then I apologise that you don't like to hear the truth and you don't like transparency. Quite frankly, it is well-recorded within this chamber's contribution of the facts that over the last decade the coalition government did gut the arts sector, did not support it. We now have a minister who is committed and has consulted with the sector and has a clear vision for the future of the arts sector in this country. We believe Australian stories should be told. We believe that Australian children should know about their history, their culture. And we believe that we have the world's best artists and creativity in this country, and we're very proud of it.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    We know that the coalition government slashed Creative Australia altogether, with no replacement, and they utterly failed to even acknowledge the lived experience of Australian artists for a decade. They're the facts that are now on the public record once again. Let's be very clear: the opposition should be ashamed of themselves for deliberately excluding artists from federal cost-of-living support during the pandemic. You never supported them during the pandemic, so how can you come here now and cry foul about me putting on the record what you did when you were in government?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Artists went through the toughest time, but, as usual, you come in here and you cry crocodile tears. Well, let me assure the Australian artists and the Australian arts community that that support, the support that they are now getting from the Albanese Labor government, will continue to go beyond the five years that we have budgeted for now. We actually have a minister who is embedded into the music sector, who has a real interest in artists, and we will deliver on our National Cultural Policy and its inclusive roadmap for enriching Australia's art and culture, spanning all areas of government policy—ranging from the cultural exchange in foreign affairs, to health and particularly to education and creating Australian jobs that I feel so passionately about.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I note Senator Brown, Senator Bilyk and my good friend Senator Jonathon Duniam who likes to promote my TikTok videos are here. When you are based in a beautiful state like Tasmania, and in particular in Launceston, you'll know the arts have had a profoundly positive impact on our local communities, touching the lives of Tasmanians and generating unparalleled job opportunities for aspiring artists. I dare to say that the arts sector's centre of the universe is in Launceston, in the north of the state, but it goes out across the entire state.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I am proud of the diverse, vibrant, remarkable range of creative arts content produced locally in my home community and my home state of Tasmania.

                          Those in the coalition may not like the Albanese Labor government and the fact that we recognise the significance of this sector—and we recognise the sanctimonious attitude of those opposite—but we believe that the arts are essential within our community, not just from an economic point of view but from a cultural point of view. We have a vision that we will take forward, and we are proud to do that. It will be known as
                          <i>
                           Revive
                          </i>
                          , and the reason we chose that name is because it was in desperate need of support and revival. Our artists create, as I said, not just for our local economies or in terms of jobs. More importantly, they're educators of our culture, and the impact that they have on our generations cannot be underestimated. So we acknowledge the outstanding commitment that is made by artists. We feel for them, that they were neglected during the pandemic by those opposite. But we have taken a very strong stand; we have consulted with them, and we've laid out our vision with them. We are now going to leave a footprint that others can walk in behind as we go forward.

Those on the other side can laugh about what we've been able to put together going forward, but, if I were on their side of the chamber, I would be hanging my head in shame at the neglect that this sector felt over the last decade. I would be ashamed to say that I was a colleague of someone like the former minister, for his neglect and the way that he gutted the Australian arts sector.

                                 I stand before you today to advocate for the passage of the Creative Australia Bill 2023 and the Creative Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2023. This legislation not only acknowledges the immense cultural and economic value of the creative arts sector but also demonstrates the Albanese government's commitment to fostering a vibrant and sustainable future for Australian creativity. The creative arts industry is the lifeblood of our nation's cultural identity, and it plays a pivotal role in shaping our society. From literature and visual arts to film, music and performing arts, our creative sector enriches our lives, stimulates critical thinking and reflects the diversity of our communities. It is after all only through the telling of our unique and diverse stories that we can truly understand and appreciate our identity as a nation. The Creative Australia bill is founded on the belief that the arts are not just a mere luxury for the elite but a fundamental pillar of all sectors of society. It recognises that the arts have the power to ignite imagination, challenge perceptions and foster social cohesion. By supporting and investing in the arts, we are investing in the very essence of what it means to be Australian, in a diverse, vibrant and culturally rich nation.

                                <p>
                                 It's important to note that the arts and cultural industry is not just an expression of our identity and values. As I've said, it is a vital economic force that generates jobs, stimulates tourism and drives innovation. As an industry, it contributes $17 billion to our annual economy and provides employment opportunities for an estimated 400,000 Australians. I'm really proud that historically it has been Labor. It has been Labor governments that have consistently supported and championed the arts in Australia.

                                 The Whitlam government was the first to truly recognise the immense importance of the arts. In his 1972 campaign speech, Whitlam outlined his arts policy as being guided by four main objectives: to promote a standard of excellence in the arts, to widen access to the arts in the community generally, to help establish and express an Australian identity through the arts and to promote an awareness of Australian culture abroad. That was truly visionary. It reflected a new confidence and maturity and inspired us to embrace our unique national identity, challenging the prevailing cultural cringe which persisted amongst Australians at the time.

                                 The Whitlam government was the first to introduce minimum Australian music content for commercial radio stations. It also established what would later become triple J, a station specifically designed to support and promote Australian music and connect with young Australians. The legacy of this great institution of youth culture and music cannot be underestimated. Since commencement, it has unearthed and promoted countless Australian music artists, many of whom have since found success on the international stage.

                                 The strong foundations to Australian arts and culture of the Whitlam government continued to be built upon under the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. Reaffirming its true relationship with the arts was the implementation of the Creative Nation policy in 1994. Not only did Creative Nation provide significant funding for the arts and cultural industries, this landmark policy also had the distinction of being the first Commonwealth cultural policy document in Australia's history. The impact of this policy was profound. It changed the way Australians saw themselves and their place in the world by redefining culture as 'that which gives us a sense of ourselves' rather than something only for the elites to enjoy. At its heart, it sought to recognise and embrace multiculturalism in Australia. Describing Australian culture as 'now an exotic hybrid' in the document's preamble, it highlighted the importance of Indigenous and migrant cultures in creating a national cultural identity. It therefore marks an important step in changing of the narrative of Australian identity, one which sought to include non-white Australians in the national project.

                                <p>
                                 This was emphasised by the funding and establishment of the Australian National Institute for Indigenous Performing Arts as well as the creation of a database for Chinese, Japanese and Korean language texts in Australia, allowing for a much more inclusive approach to the arts for all Australians.

                                <p>
                                 It should be noted that Creative Nation was as much an economic policy as it was a cultural one; the economic benefits of the arts could not be ignored. The Creative Nation policy therefore reframed how the cultural industry was perceived. No longer would it be viewed as art for art's sake, but rather as a vital contributor to Australia's economic success. From Creative Nation onwards, art was for everyone rather than just the elite. Cultural engagement was vital not only to the aspirations of the nation but to the economy as well. The Gillard government further expanded the Creative Nation policy in 2013, reaffirming the centrality of the arts to our national identity, social cohesion and economic success. This expanded policy also recognised the importance of keeping pace with the emergence of new digital platforms, providing additional support to the innovative development of new creative content in creative industries.

                                 The Albanese government is proud to build upon the proud legacy and visionary commitment to the arts of previous Labor governments with the introduction of the Creative Australia Bill 2023. It recognises the invaluable role of the creative sector in our society and seeks to provide it with the necessary resources and infrastructure for it to thrive. Unlike the previous government, the Albanese government has listened to the voice of the creative arts. We have listened to their voices at 14 town hall meetings attended by 800 stakeholders, and I was very pleased to attend the first town hall meeting in Hobart. And we've heard their voices in the more than 1,200 submissions to the National Cultural Policy inquiry. This extensive consultation has led us to the formation of the government's National Cultural Policy,

This legislation will strengthen the capacity of the Australia Council and provide greater strategic oversight and engagement across the sector. Importantly, it will ensure that funding decisions will continue to be made based on artistic merit and at arm's length from the government.

                                 Labor's approach to the arts stands in stark contrast to that of the previous government. Artists and arts organisations were breathing a sigh of relief when we were elected to government, because they finally had a government that values their work, not just for its economic output but for the contribution it makes to cultural expression and national identity, and to enhancing the lives of Australians. This is what has been missing from arts policy for almost a decade, under the governments led by former prime ministers Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison. What was also missing under the Liberals and Nationals was any sense of an overarching framework of a coherent and principles based approach to arts policy. That framework, that coherence, existed back when we had the Keating government's Creative Nation and the Gillard government's Creative Australia, demonstrating that Labor is the only true friend of the arts in government.

                                 Under the Albanese Labor government, the notion of an overarching approach being embedded into every aspect of arts policy is back again, with our National Cultural Policy,

                                 , and its five pillars—a place for every story and a story for every place. To illustrate what a radical shift in attitude to the arts this is, it's worth reflecting on the chaos and vandalism of the previous government when it came to arts policy, and on the damage that was done after a decade of those opposite in power.

I've had a number of meetings with organisations such as Screen Producers Australia, and I admire the strong advocacy and representations they give for their industry. Prior to the last election they made quite clear the damage that was being done to screen production by the suspension of local content quotas for Australian drama, documentary and children's programs, and also the failure of the previous government to make any serious efforts to introduce Australian content quotas for video and on-demand streaming services.

                                 The screen production industry in Australia includes actors, directors, writers, producers, set crews and graphic artists, to name a few. They compete with a global industry that achieves massive economies of scale, including countries that have their very own generous local content quotas. For our industry, it's like being an amateur boxer taking on the heavyweight champion with one hand tied behind their back.

                                 During the COVID pandemic the previous government made the future very uncertain for 50,000 professional artists and 600,000 arts workers by refusing to extend JobKeeper eligibility to many artists and arts organisations, including some that lost 100 per cent of their revenue. When museums, galleries, theatres, television studios and live music venues closed their doors, when concerts, festivals and exhibitions were cancelled, many of the artists they supported got no help from those opposite. The previous government shelled out over $19 billion in JobKeeper payments to companies whose revenue went up, but their lack of support for the arts industry demonstrated the utter contempt they have for arts and artists. Under enormous pressure, the package for the arts industry was eventually boosted by $250 million. But this wasn't delivered until several months into the pandemic, after significant public pressure. Compare this funding for the entire multibillion-dollar arts sector to the $100 million that the previous government gave to zoos.

                                 I also vividly recall, when I was a member of the legal and constitutional affairs committee, taking the lead for Labor on an inquiry into the then government's savage cuts to the arts under Minister

                                 . The government at that time cut $105 million from the Australia Council for the Arts, an independent body that made merit based decisions about arts funding, and directed it to their little slush fund, Catalyst—a slush fund that was so doled out at the whim of the minister. The inquiry held a series of public hearings across Australia, attended by possibly hundreds of witnesses. Witness after witness lined up to defend the Australia Council and highlight the shortsightedness of the coalition government's policy. With all their efforts to find a witness on the other side—and they went to a lot of effort to find a witness favourable to their position—the government was only able to produce—do you know how many? One witness, out of hundreds—and, I've got to say, he wasn't particularly credible at that. Granted, Catalyst was eventually shut down and the funding was returned to the Australia Council, but only after significant pressure was applied by thousands of furious artists and arts organisations across Australia.

                                 In summation, the Creative Australia Bill 2023 is more than just legislation; it's a bold declaration of Labor's strong heritage of commitment to the arts and an acknowledgement of the transformative power that creativity holds. It's a call to action to embrace and support our artists, to nurture our cultural institutions and to recognise the vital role the arts play in our collective identity and our economy. Let's build a creative Australia together, a nation that values and celebrates its artists, a nation that fosters innovation and creativity.

I can remember when George Brandis was appointed arts minister and was appointed sports minister at the same time—and, I must say, it was the subject of some reflection by those of us who have known George for a long time that he was appointed sports minister as well as arts minister! I can remember congratulating him when he was appointed arts minister, and I think he was absolutely outstanding as an arts minister. The feedback I received not from politicians, not from senators, but from those involved in the arts in Queensland, was that he was considered an outstanding arts minister—just as my party, the Liberal Party, has produced many outstanding arts ministers at all levels of government over the decades.

                                  The first point I want to make is: if you listened to those opposite—for those in the gallery listening to this debate and no doubt the millions of people at home listening to the debate—you would have thought the coalition government spent no money on arts. That's what you would think—that we did nothing, that it was a barren wasteland, that it was a desert devoid of all culture. The reality—and this isn't just political rhetoric, not Senator Bilyk's political rhetoric; these are the facts—is that, in the 2021-22 financial year, the coalition government delivered record arts funding. Would you have known that from the speeches you heard from those opposite? You would have thought we didn't give a brass razoo to the arts. But, in fact, we delivered record arts funding of over $1 billion. No Labor government has ever matched this level of funding for the arts. It was over $1 billion in 2021-22.

                                  I saw the impact of that in the region in Queensland where my office is based. I have gone to regional art galleries who've been able to put on exhibitions from local artists, including the wonderful art gallery of Toogoolawah in the Somerset region. They were able to put on those exhibitions because of the support that they received from the coalition government. The cinemas were able to keep their doors open during the COVID pandemic because of the support they got from the coalition government.

                                  My main point with respect to the policy we are hearing from those opposite—and this is the main difference between Labor and the coalition in terms of policy on this point—is that we philosophically believe any money provided by the government in relation to supporting the arts should actually go to the artist. That's what we believe. The money that's coming from government—that's taxpayers' money—should be delivered in the most efficient and effective way possible to the artists. For the theatre companies, the ballet companies, the opera companies, the symphonies all across Australia, the regional art galleries and whatever—we should get as much money as we can as efficiently and effectively to the artists, not build layers of bureaucracy for people sitting in offices in Canberra to determine what the culture of Australia should be. That culture is determined by the people of Australia. To the extent that the government provides support for the arts, it should be delivered directly to the artists and the performing companies themselves so that they can display their creativity and have support to express their creativity, rather than bureaucrats in Canberra determining what their creative output should be. That's our main philosophical concern.

                                    Directed art—that's right. Bureaucratic art—we don't want that. People should go back and have a look at some of the turgid art that was produced over the years and came out of the old

                                    . That was state dictated art. There was that brutalist architecture, devoid of any humanity, devoid of any art. That's the art you get out of bureaucracy. Give the funding to the grassroots, to all those wonderful artists out there. Give the money to the grassroots as effectively and efficiently as possible. Deliver it to them.

                                    will increase by 32 per cent—from an estimated 108 in 2022-23 to 143. What are these people going to be doing? Our Public Service does a wonderful job in this city—absolutely—and they have to do what the ministers dictate. To the extent the ministers want to set a government dictated cultural policy and dictate how we should be creative, I guess the public servants just have to do their best—but what are all these people going to be doing? What are these extra 35 people going to be doing? Why don't we give the money direct to the artists, to the performers and to the venues? There are wonderful venues in my home state of Queensland which need support. This is where the money should be going—not to bureaucracy but to the performers, the theatres and those who need that support, especially young performers starting on their artistic journeys. I congratulate each and every one of them. The next

                                    and the next great painters—we should be supporting them at the grassroots level. That's our basic philosophical objection to the approach of the government in relation to this matter.

                                    In conclusion, I would like to pay my respects to, and say something positive about, the previous arts minister, Minister Fletcher. I think he did an outstanding job as arts minister. I was listening reasonably carefully, between my interjections, and I noted that there wasn't much said about then minister Fletcher by those opposite. But I think he did do an outstanding job as arts minister, especially during the COVID pandemic, which was a very, very difficult time. In my discussions with him, conveying the concerns of my constituents in my home state of Queensland, he took his responsibilities in that regard extremely seriously. I would like to see the great work that then minister Fletcher discharged in that role built upon, not detracted from, during the term of this parliament and during the course of this government.

                                     I table a correction to the explanatory memorandum relating to the Creative Australia Bill 2023, which will be circulated in the chamber. I thank all those who have contributed to this debate and acknowledge the support that has been given across the chamber. Some questions have been asked during contributions, which I will go to during my summing-up contribution.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     The legislation demonstrates a strong commitment to support arts and culture, and it is clear from the debate that arts is crucial to everything that we do. It strengthens communities, enhances health and wellbeing and provides the skills of the future. The formation of Creative Australia through this bill transforms Australia's principal arts funding body into a modern entity that is able to harness the current opportunities available to the art and entertainment sector by bringing together public, philanthropic and commercial support for the arts. This is a strategic shift that will create greater leverage opportunities in the arts. Creative Australia will provide more support to our valued art and culture sector through restoring the Brandis cuts and increasing funding and services for artists, arts workers and businesses.

                                    <p>
                                     Through this legislation, artists, entertainers, arts workers and arts organisations will be better supported. Audiences will have greater access to Australian stories through new music, literature, performances and other creative practices and can be inspired or moved by the sounds and sights they hear and see. Revive, the government's national cultural policy, this Creative Australia Bill and the government's record investment in the arts sector sets a new course for Australia's arts and culture sector.

                                     into Creative Australia and position it as an enhanced entity with expanded functions and responsibilities and new governance structures. As the centrepiece of Revive, Creative Australia will deliver on a bold new agenda for the creative sector and be the champion for Australian stories and arts practised both here and across the world.

                                     The bill is not about creating more arts officials or extra layers of bureaucracy. I understand this is a concern that was raised by Senator Henderson, Senator Davey and, of course, Senator Scarr. It's not about creating more arts officials or an extra layer of bureaucracy; it's about bringing government funded arts, arts philanthropy and the commercial art sectors together in one organisation. The formation of Creative Australia through the bill transforms Australia's principal arts funding body into a modern entity, as I've said. A new board will be appointed under the legislation which will be the governing and accountable authority for Creative Australia. The board will retain the name 'Australia Council Board' to maintain its connection to the creation of the Australia Council by the Whitlam government in 1975. A staged approach has been agreed by government to enable Creative Australia to scale up responsibly and to implement new functions.

                                     arts and culture, and for writers, will come later. First Nations First will be established following an extensive consultation process, and its functions will consider the needs of the sector to deliver Creative Australia's First Nations First funding program. It will identify and plan for strategic investments and will commence activities in 2024. Writers Australia will be established in line with the commencement of funding by mid-2025.

                                     To support our artists to tell our stories, we must improve the quality of Commonwealth investment in the arts sector and strengthen and streamline access to support, including for artists and art organisations. The Creative Australia Bill 2023, with the expanded functions of Music Australia and Creative Workplaces, along with the dedicated councils, is key to delivering on this commitment. I again also want to touch on the issue and concerns about extra bureaucrats. The agency has a very efficient track record of spending only five per cent on administrative costs, and of course we value the work of public servants; their work will be critical. So I think I can assure Senator Scarr, in particular, about efficient and effective management by public servants.

                                     There was a question about board appointments, I think maybe from Senator Henderson. Minister Burke has made many comments about the importance of skills based board appointments. Section 22(3) of this bill specifically says that the minister must be:
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="italic">
                                     … satisfied that the person has appropriate qualifications, knowledge, skills or experience.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     Again, I remind senators that
                                     <i>
                                      Revive

                                     is backed by a $286 million funding package and that it is new money, of which $199 million is going to Creative Australia. And the correction that I just tabled, Senator Henderson, clarifies that the minister's directions are not subject to disallowance. The word 'not' has been added.

                                       On indulgence, I'm seeking a clarification about that last point made on the explanatory memorandum. I sit on the scrutiny committee, so I watch this very closely. Is it moving from being subject to disallowance to not being subject to disallowance?

                                          Senator Henderson, we're not in committee stage at the moment, and I'm about to move the question on the second reading. If a committee stage is required to clarify this issue then we'll do that, but I'm not going to have extensive debate across the chamber on this matter; it's not timely. The question is that the bills now be read a second time.
