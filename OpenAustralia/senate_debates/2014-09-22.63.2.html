         thank Senator Smith for that very important question on what is a genuine international threat and, as we have seen and witnessed in recent days, that has fundamental domestic relevance to Australia as well. ISIL is a terrorist organisation. Its ambitions know no borders and delight in publicising wanton and barbaric acts of violence, terror and execution. There are now 1.8 million internally displaced people within Iraq. The Australian government is appalled by what appear to be a third video of an ISIL beheading, this time of a British aid worker, and by the gruesome beheadings of two innocent
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         journalists, and numerous other atrocities in Iraq and Syria.
        </p>
        <p>
         The overwhelming majority of Australians and I am sure everyone in this chamber find the barbarism of ISIL absolutely and utterly abhorrent. The emergence of ISIL and its universal declaration of an Islamic caliphate has concerning ramifications for Australia and our region as well as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         . The decision by Australia to join the international coalition of some 40 nations to prepare and deploy a military force to counter the ISIL threat was not one that was taken lightly or with haste. These are grave decisions for any government and for any opposition to support.
        </p>
        <p>
         It should be noted that our security experts have been concerned for the past 18 months about foreign fighters travelling to the region to further terrorist causes. Currently, we know there are at least 60 Australians fighting with ISIL and other terrorist groups, and another 100 or so supporting these extremists.

             I acknowledge the bipartisan support of the opposition. As the opposition leader has himself acknowledged, this is a matter above politics. Australia has prepared and deployed a military force and provided humanitarian assistance at the request of the United States and Iraqi governments. This is part of a broader partnership of more than 40 nations. In his key address to the

              My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Cormann. I refer to the Treasurer's statement on 15 September 2014 that Defence will be asked to absorb 'a significant amount of costs associated with participation in the international coalition against ISIL.' Is the Treasurer correct, or will the government maintain the practice of supplementing the net additional cost of major overseas operations on a no win, no loss basis?

               I thank Senator Cameron for that question. Firstly, Senator Cameron would be well aware that, under this government, Defence is actually now on a funding growth trajectory again, unlike under the previous government. So there is an expectation that Defence will be able to absorb costs related to this particular activity over the next few months. The truth is, as Senator Wong would well know, that there are regular updates when it comes to budget estimates. So we will be updating the impact on the budget forward estimates in the usual way in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.

                 No, I am not in a position to confirm that figure. What I am in a position to confirm is what I have just said in response to the primary question. That is that the government will provide updates on the fiscal impact of our engagement in the international action against ISIL in the usual way, in our usual regular budget updates—the next one of course being the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.

                  , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that you have indicated that there will be a report in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, could you provide details of exactly what you will be reporting on? Could you indicate whether you do believe that it will be a significant amount in the region of a quarter of a billion dollars every six months?

                   That is not a very serious question. This is obviously an evolving situation. The government is involved in making serious decisions in the national interest. The government is dealing with these matters in the national interest in the exact same way as the previous government would have dealt with it. This is not, and should not be, a matter of partisan—

                    , I rise on a point of order going to relevance. It is entirely appropriate for the opposition to be asking about the cost of this engagement and it is entirely appropriate for us to be asking questions about public statements. I draw the minister's attention—

                      As I have indicated, the government is obviously involved right now in making decisions. It is ongoing—it is obviously an evolving situation and there are decisions being made. This government will provide updates, as appropriate, in the usual way. Of course we understand the need to be accountable and we will be.
