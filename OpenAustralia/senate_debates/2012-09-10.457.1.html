         </a>
         and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The current number of supported permanent residents (as at 31 March 2012), broken down by ABS Remoteness Area Classification for each state and territory is in Table 1 of Attachment A.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The current number of concessional permanent residents (as at 31 March 2012), broken down by ABS Remoteness Area Classification for each state and territory is in Table 2 of Attachment A.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The current number of residential aged care facilities that have more than 50 per cent of permanent residents who are either concessional or supported (as at 31 March 2012), broken down for each state and territory is in Table 3 of Attachment A.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The Department does not collect this information.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) (a)
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACFI" rel="nofollow">
          ACFI
         </a>
         review visits to services will look at a sample of claims at those services. In 2010-11, 1,120 out of 1,697 services (66%) visited through the ACFI Review Program were subject to one or more downgrades of ACFI claims under section 29-1 of the Aged Care Act 1997.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Data collection for the 2011-12 financial year is not yet complete, however as at 3 August 2012, 876 out of 1,416 services (61%) visited through the ACFI Review Program were subject to one or more downgrades of ACFI claims under section 29-1 of the Aged Care Act 1997.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Residential aged care subsidy funding is calculated on a daily basis and this rate can change a number of times. Attempts to calculate savings would place an unreasonably high demand on resources.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) In 2010-11, of the new entrants into residential aged care who paid by bond:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         (This data is as reported by aged care providers in the 2010-11 Survey of Aged Care Homes, which had a response rate of 91%).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) I announced the establishment of the Aged Care Financing Authority on 1 August 2012. Its role is to provide transparent, independent, advice to the Government on pricing and financing issues in aged care.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The ACFA will be responsible for advising how the level (or levels) of Accommodation Payments for aged care homes should be set. The cost of supplying aged care accommodation will vary considerably depending upon location and the quality of the building stock. It is expected that the ACFA will take these matters into account in providing its advice.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (8) While the reforms will inevitably bring changes, there is no Government policy regarding the number of providers or structure of the sector. Rather, the focus is on improving the efficiency and financial sustainability of the sector, increasing the focus on care in the home, providing consumers with greater choice and control, and ensuring access to affordable, high quality care and services.
