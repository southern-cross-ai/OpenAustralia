         I thank Senator Abetz for that question. I also thank him for his enduring support of our men and women in uniform and for Defence. Building a stronger Australia post pandemic rests on a secure and stable Indo-Pacific. That is why defence is supporting not only our own national recovery from COVID-19 but also the recovery of our regional friends and partners.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have already reoriented funding through the government's defence cooperation programs to assist our regional partners deal with COVID-19. This is in addition to the significant support that the ADF has provided on Operation COVID-19 Assist. Over 10,000 ADF members have been contributing to state and territory responses since the beginning of this year. In the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
          South Pacific
         </a>
         our support has focused on very targeted country specific priorities. This includes planning, health, logistics, vehicle and asset maintenance and the delivery of personal protective equipment and also supplies.
        </p>
        <p>
         In South-East Asia, Australia has supported regional defence forces to respond to the pandemic. One example is a $2 million package of personal protective equipment to Indonesia's armed forces to support and assist in their ability to deal with their own nation's COVID-19 response. A second example is a total of $3 million of assistance to the

            Again, thank you very much, Senator Abetz, for the question. Throughout COVID-19 one of the proudest things our nation has seen is that the ADF have not missed a beat. Yes, we've had to adapt work practices but we have not missed a beat throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time Australia has continued to strengthen its military-to-military engagement with its partners—partners who share our vision for a stable, prosperous and rules based Indo-Pacific. This is despite the many challenges facing us all with COVID-19. For example, our regional presence deployment, which ran from July to September, was the largest-ever ADF deployment to the Indo-Pacific. We exercised with 11 nations in total. The Navy has conducted seven separate maritime activities with Japan alone this year. Australia participated in the Malabar maritime exercise last month with close partners India, Japan and the United States, and those exercises continue.

                 I'm sure Senator Abetz is very capable of answering his own questions! In all seriousness, Defence is continuing to support our Pacific family to address the health and economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Work continues apace with

                 , Fiji and Vanuatu on significant defence infrastructure projects in those nations that will enhance security and also provide much-needed economic stimulus and local employment opportunities in those nations. Those projects in those three countries alone are expected to create over 350 jobs in Papua New Guinea, 555 jobs in Fiji and 178 jobs in Vanuatu, with many more to come. Defence continues to deliver new Guardian class patrol boats throughout COVID-19, with eight to date to regional partners under the Pacific Maritime Security Program. In fact, Tonga received its second Guardian class patrol boat during a COVID-safe handover at Henderson in October. This program fundamentally supports regional sovereignty—
