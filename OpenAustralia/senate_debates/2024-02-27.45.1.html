        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallagher" rel="nofollow">
         Gallagher
        </a>
        . Does the Prime Minister agree with Labor's candidate in the seat of Dunkley that the referendum result was a display of 'the worst white privilege in the country'?

         I thank Senator Nampijinpa Price for the question. I haven't seen those comments, but I think the Prime Minister has made it very clear that we accept Australian voters decision on the referendum. It wasn't a position we argued for. We supported a Voice to Parliament. It was unfortunate that it got so political and contested.

          No, I do. But we accept the outcome of the referendum and we are focused on making a practical difference for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           First Nations

          people in this country. That is the Prime Minister's focus, that is the Minister for Indigenous Affairs' focus. My colleague
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_McCarthy" rel="nofollow">
           Senator McCarthy
          </a>
          and all of us, we are focused on jobs, on housing, on education, on community support, on making a difference. I think we all accept in this chamber that the information that was released in
          <i>

          <i>

          shows that we have a long way to go to meet the needs of and support Indigenous communities across this country. That is the focus of this government.
         </p>
         <p>
          The candidate for Dunkley is an excellent candidate for the Labor Party. She's been a strong advocate for women in her electorate. She was recruited by the late Peta Murphy when she was the member for Dunkley because she saw the qualities that Ms Belyea will bring to this parliament, the difference she will make. We stand by her. We support her. I have no doubt she will be an excellent member for Dunkley.
         </p>
         <p>
          I haven't seen the comments that Senator Nampijinpa Price refers to, but I again refer the senator to the work that the government is doing and the position the Prime Minister took post the election.

             My answer is the same. We accept the outcome of the referendum. We accept that a majority of Australians did not support the question that was put to them. The government remains focused on the serious work at hand.

              report that has been recently released should refocus all of our attention on the gaps that exist and the work that needs to happen.

                            I have answered the question. You don't like the answer, Senator Rennick. They are two different things. The Prime Minister has made it clear that the work we are doing in government is to deal with closing the gap in those priority areas that we are focused on and that the Minister for Indigenous Affairs is leading, ably supported by every single one of us in this caucus who wants to make a difference and close the gap, not talk about everything else.
