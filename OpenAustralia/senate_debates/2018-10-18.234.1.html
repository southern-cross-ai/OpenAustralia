        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. Sensitive communications between Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Indonesian foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, in relation to Prime Minister Morrison's decision to overturn bipartisan foreign policy have been leaked to the media. What steps will the government take to investigate the source of this leak?

                  <p>
                   Well, a vote for Dave Sharma and the Liberals in Wentworth is a vote for stability, because it will help to deliver a continuation of good economic management, good budget management and a continuation of a government implementing a plan for the economy and jobs, which has delivered record employment across Australia. More people are in jobs in Australia today than ever before, and more women are in jobs today than ever before. Indeed, the proportion of working-age Australians on welfare is the lowest it has been in 20 years. That is because, as we have created more jobs and better opportunities for families around Australia to get ahead, more people have been able to get off welfare and into a job, and surely that is something the senator should be supporting, and it's a great demonstration of the successful economic and fiscal policies of this government.
