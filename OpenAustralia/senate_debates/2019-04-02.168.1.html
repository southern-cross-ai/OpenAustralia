        I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion 1422 standing in my name for today, relating to budget asks for Australian women, at the request of Labor, to delete some specific funding amounts for domestic violence and abortion before asking that it be taken as a formal motion.

            The coalition government released information about the budget measures for women in budget fact sheets and initiated the Women's Economic Security Statement, which provides practical measures to support women. This government is making the single largest ever Commonwealth investment in combating domestic violence. This government is making parental leave pay more flexible so that families have choices and can make decisions about what works best for them. This government has established Australia as the global leader in gender equality and women's empowerment, advancing the rights of women and girls as a top priority across the aid program by delivering $1.3 billion in official development assistance in 2017-18 that targeted gender equality globally.

               This is not my first speech. Whilst it is perfectly fine to make motions about various women's issues, it's important not to skirt around issues that affect men in particular and there are some issues here that are a bit odd. Yes, it is the case that there are a growing number of older women in homelessness, but it is important to note that a great majority of homeless people in Australia are men and that the issue is rising for men. Between 2011 and 2016, 41 out of 10,000 women were homeless, which is terrible. It stayed at that level between 2011 and 2016. For men, it was 54 out of 10,000 in 2011 and had risen to 58 out of 10,000 by 2016. So there are real issues here, but skirting around the even deeper issue for men in this society seems a bit odd.
