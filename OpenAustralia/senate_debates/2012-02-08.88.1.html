        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Senator Carr. Can the minister explain whether there is any empirical and independent evidence upon which the government relies in claiming that creating a road safety remuneration tribunal will increase road safety by increasing truck drivers' pay rates and, if so, what is that evidence?

         I am sure everyone in this Senate will be concerned with the fact that 250 people are killed and over 1,000 people are seriously injured due to heavy vehicle accidents on our roads on an annual basis. Most of these deaths come about as a result of collisions with trucks. The road transport sector continues to have the highest incidence of fatal injuries compared with all other industries, with 25 deaths per 100,000 workers. From the latest statistics that have been made available to me, that is about 10 times the rate of all other industries.
        </p>
        <p>
         The senator asked me what evidence there is that the question of road safety could be enhanced by this. Research by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transport_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          National Transport Commission
         </a>
         shows that low rates of pay can lead to risky work practices being pursued as a result of the people driving these vehicles trying to make ends meet. These risky road practices include dangerous actions such as speeding, working very long hours and using illicit drugs to stay awake. Frankly, this is a practice that cannot continue. One would have thought that everyone in this place would have shared that view. That is why the government has introduced legislation to establish a national road safety remuneration system comprising a tribunal and a separate education and compliance framework. I trust that if the legislation is passed by the parliament the tribunal will begin work on 1 July this year. Then we can test not just the research work that has been undertaken in this area but also the practical application.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister explain exactly how paying truck drivers more will result in fewer road accidents and say whether the government modelled the benefits of increasing road safety by funding better roads rather than funding a specialist tribunal to increase truckies' pay?

           Senator Fisher, you asked me whether or not there is any evidence that paying people more improves their performance, in effect. I do not know if you have ever supported anyone getting a pay rise, but I suspect that maybe you have not. All I urge you to do is to check the
           <i>
            Hansard
           </i>
           for what I have already told you, which is that there is very clear evidence that people who are forced to work on poverty wages take risks they should not have to take. If you are asking people to work for that sort of money, you have to expect that there will be action taken by people trying to preserve the livelihoods of their families. As a consequence, people work longer hours, they take drugs, they speed and they take action which is dangerous to other people. So the fact that we are asking for people to be paid a decent wage is something this government is proud of.

                 <p>
                  Perhaps I should reiterate. The government's position is that we want to provide opportunities for truck drivers to be paid reasonable rates so that they can get on with doing their jobs, and to get rid of any economic incentives for them to take unacceptable risks that endanger not just their lives but also other people's lives. It is unacceptable for this parliament to ignore its own responsibilities in this regard, and the government is taking steps to improve road safety. You would have thought those opposite would applaud us rather than seek to undermine what is an appropriate and, I think, long overdue reform.
