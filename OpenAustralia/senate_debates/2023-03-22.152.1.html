           Hang on a second, Senator Scarr. I know you like to answer my questions before I get the opportunity! Put your seatbelt on for a second. The federal government takes compliance matters very seriously, and the

            Gold Corporation

           , which trades as the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Mint" rel="nofollow">
            Perth Mint
           </a>
           , assessing compliance with anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism finance law, is due to report in May 2023. They are the responsibilities of the federal government. They are in place. That is the position of the Albanese government. Calls for a royal commission by the WA opposition should be matters that the WA parliament deals with, and the suitable response should be there. But we are satisfied with the work that is underway via AUSTRAC doing their assessment, which is due to report to the government, or due to release its report, in May 2023.

               Premier, Mr McGowan, has made it clear that the government is aware of these matters. There is presently an audit underway and the

               is also investing heavily in anticriminal behaviour measures and compliance measures. As to whether there's a political dispute that the opposition in WA is running, which you are running by proxy through this chamber, Senator Brockman, I think that's largely a matter for the Western Australian parliament. If you want to have a say in that, maybe you should stand over there and have a say in the parliament there. They might need a couple of extra bodies over there. On the matter of substance, that is why there is an

I think that is a pretty swift response. As to conversations between governments, I have no doubt that there have been some.
