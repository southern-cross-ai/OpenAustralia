            . Just so we're all clear in the chamber: you were granted leave to put the amendment, and then you sought leave to make a one-minute statement. Leave wasn't given. Because we're in formal motions, there's no opportunity to speak, so we will put the suspension. Senator Birmingham?

              Madam President
             </a>
             . One is perhaps to try to help the Senate. My understanding is that convention has been that where an amendment is moved a senator is granted leave to make a short, one-minute statement in relation to the amendment. So I'd encourage the government to reconsider that.
            </p>
            <p>
             In relation to the motion Senator
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGrath" rel="nofollow">
              McGrath
             </a>
             just moved, he had sought leave to make a one-minute statement. Being denied that, and on the basis of that, he used contingent notice standing in my name to suspend standing orders so as to enable him to make the one-minute statement.

              Yes, and what I explained to the chamber, Senator Birmingham, as you'll recall, is that during formal motions, which is where we're up to, there's no opportunity to speak to a suspension. So you can suspend, but then we immediately put the suspension question. I understand there is no leave given to make a one-minute statement. Senator

                   Unless it's amended, I will not be supporting this motion. Senator Green has decided to finish the year with a motion about extremism, notably only right-wing. Does her omission of the opera house Hamas rally that called for Jews to be gassed mean the senator is endorsing that call? Does her omission of environmental extremism that terrorised a female executive in her home mean the senator is endorsing that? Apparently so.
