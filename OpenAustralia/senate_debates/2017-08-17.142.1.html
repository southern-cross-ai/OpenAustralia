         I thank Senator Fawcett for the question. Last week I was in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
          Solomon Islands
         </a>
         representing the Australian people at the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Guadalcanal" rel="nofollow">
          Battle of Guadalcanal

         and commemorations of the sinking of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
          HMAS

         <i>
          Canberra
         </i>
         off Honiara on 9 August 1942.
        </p>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle" rel="nofollow">
          The Battle
         </a>
         of Guadalcanal was the first major offensive and victory for the Allies in the Pacific. Importantly, the allied engagement of the Japanese at Guadalcanal meant that Japan could not afford to reinforce its troops on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoda_Track" rel="nofollow">
          Kokoda Track
         </a>
         , and therefore it provided a critical turning point for victory in the Pacific and it contributed to the ultimate defence of Australia and, may I say, of the freedoms that we hold dear.
        </p>
        <p>
         During the Battle of Guadalcanal, Allied forces lost approximately 7,000 lives. Twenty-nine ships were sunk and 615 aircraft were shot down. Japanese forces lost almost 20,000 lives, 38 ships and 880 aircraft.

         HMAS
         <i>

         was the lead ship in an Allied screening force and was protecting the landing of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

         marines on Guadalcanal when it was hit multiple times in a surprise attack by a powerful Japanese naval force in the early hours of 9 August 1942. She suffered irreparable damage and, the morning after, she was scuttled. Eighty-four crew were killed in the attack, including the ship's captain, Captain Getting. A further 109 were injured. HMAS

         remains the largest Australian warship ever lost in battle.

        <p>
         I also represented the government at a very moving ceremony on board HMAS

         at the very point where the

             Solomon Islands

            for their commitment not just to these events but to the commemoration of those who have died. We now have a memorial to the

            in Honiara. We also have a monument to the brave Australian Coastwatchers and the scouts that worked so hard behind enemy lines. They provided very vital information to the Allies. It was wonderful to be there when we provided medallions in recognition of this. There was a 110-year-old scout from the Solomon Islands there to proudly receive his medal from the Australian government. I also visited a place call

              <p>
               Seventy-five years ago, the security of the Pacific was of vital strategic interest to Australia. We worked with our allies in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
                Solomon Islands
               </a>
               and in other theatres of battle, as I said, to secure the Pacific and to secure our own defence. Whilst we do not now face the same direct military attack that we faced at those times, we do have challenges to our regional security. Those challenges now come in the form of the trafficking of drugs, unregulated and irregular fishing and, most importantly, instability. May we never again have a situation like we did in

                RAMSI
               </a>
               , and that is the reason why the Australian government, together with other governments in the region, contributed to this regional force. So, as it was in
