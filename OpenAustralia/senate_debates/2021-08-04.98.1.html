        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne. Can the minister update the Senate on the government's support to the rollout of vaccines to combat COVID-19 in Australia's region, including in the Pacific?

         I thank Senator Scarr for his question. Australia is standing strongly with our partners, in the Pacific and in South-East Asia, in their response to COVID-19. We are delivering on the Prime Minister's commitment at the G7 to provide up to 20 million vaccines for our neighbours, including 15 million to the Pacific and Timor-Leste and five million to South-East Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
         To date, we've delivered over one million vaccine doses to eight countries:
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea

         </a>
         , Tuvalu, Samoa, Tonga and, most recently, Vanuatu. Our contribution of Australian vaccines complements the $623 million we've committed to vaccine access, including end-to-end support for the Pacific and South-East Asia. Our Pacific flights program is sustaining air connectivity to the Pacific and Timor-Leste, ensuring life-saving vaccines and medical equipment are delivered. In Papua New Guinea, our closest neighbour, we're strongly supporting the government's campaign to lift vaccination rates. We're partnering with churches, businesses and

        </p>
        <p>
         I've been in regular contact with my counterparts on these matters. I met with

            Australia is also investing in our region's health systems—in health governance, in specialist clinical services and in training. Last financial year we provided $228 million for regional health programs in the Pacific. In

               It's fair to say that our region faces an unprecedented economic shock from COVID-19. The

                Asian Development Bank
               </a>
               has cut its growth forecasts for the Pacific from 1.4 per cent, just in April this year, to 0.3 per cent, so Australia is implementing a $500 million package of new economic development and security measures to support South-East Asia's recovery from COVID-19. We're delivering on our commitment through the Mekong-Australia Partnership and our Partnerships for Infrastructure initiative.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our Pacific COVID-19 Response Package is providing essential services, flight connectivity and increased social spending. In Fiji, we provided over $83 million in fiscal support last financial year, directly benefiting Fijians impacted by COVID-19. This complements the Fiji government's important Poverty Benefit Scheme and disability allowance for women, children and other vulnerable groups. These initiatives are key to supporting the region's resilience and recovery from COVID-19.
