        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. Over the past week

         New South Wales
        </a>
        and Queensland have been devastated by bushfires, leading to three people tragically losing their lives and countless more losing their homes. Weather forecasts are predicting that the situation will only worsen, both today and over coming days. As we all indicated yesterday, our thoughts are with all of those facing this immediate crisis and our thanks are with the crews and firefighters battling these fires across the country. In that context, I ask the minister to provide the Senate with an update on the current situation being faced by communities in New South Wales and Queensland.

         I thank Senator Wong for that question. As we indicated yesterday, our first concern is for the safety and needs of those directly affected. Australians are at their best in difficult times like this. They show incredible spirit, heart and generosity. Our emergency services are once again showing their professionalism and dedication in the face of very difficult conditions, and we thank all the career and voluntary emergency services personnel fighting these fires. I acknowledge the comradeship on display through the contribution to the

        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of updates, devastating fires continue to burn across large parts of north-east New South Wales. It is important that people remain vigilant, with more than 70 fires still burning across the state. The New South Wales fires have had a devastating impact on the many affected communities. The

          New South Wales Rural Fire Service

         estimates that at least 150 structures have been lost, including a large number of homes. Other property damage and loss include telecommunications and power infrastructure, bridges and two schools. More than 1,300 firefighters and support personnel, along with 93 aircraft, have been battling these fires. The forecast for today is deeply worrying, and all Commonwealth agencies stand ready to assist state authorities and the community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Catastrophic fire danger is forecast for the greater Sydney, greater Hunter, Illawarra and Shoalhaven areas today due to the worsening weather conditions. This is the first time such conditions have been forecast for Sydney since the new fire danger ratings were introduced in 2009. Catastrophic is the highest level of bushfire danger. It means that homes are not designed to withstand the fire under those conditions and, if a fire takes hold during catastrophic fire conditions, lives and homes will be lost. In Queensland, fires of concern are continuing to burn. In South-East Queensland 12 homes have been confirmed as destroyed. Lives and property are—
