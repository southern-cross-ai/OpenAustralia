         when she takes up that role. I will have to come back to Senator Hume if there's anything further that I can add, but I understand there was a full merit selection process which was undertaken for that appointment, and the Treasurer would have been briefed on that. It is an exciting opportunity to have Ms Wood take up that role. It's an important institution. It's an institution that the Treasurer is keen to invest in so that we can continue to get good advice from that body, particularly with the productivity challenges that have been apparent in this economy for over a decade now and some of the work that needs to be done to make sure that we are lifting productivity and enhancing living standards.

         There was a full merit process. The Treasurer would have been briefed on that. She is a fine candidate who brings a wealth of experience and expertise, including a stint at the Productivity Commission at an earlier time in her career. I look forward to working with Ms Wood, as are all members of the government, and I hope that people in the—

             I said I would come back if there was anything further I could advise on. I did indicate that there was a full merit process where candidates were interviewed. Normally as part of that process, an interview panel would have gone to an applicant's career. In this area there are people who have produced publications and been involved in policy debates. I have no doubt that through a merit process all of those matters would have been raised. She is a standout candidate, an excellent candidate, and she will be a first-rate leader of the

                I can't stand here and answer to every conversation, or have insight into every conversation that the Treasurer has had with anyone, including Ms Wood. I would hope that her appointment to this senior position in the economic portfolio would be welcomed by those opposite. She is a serious candidate with a serious

               <p>
                The government don't form the view that we have to agree with every position that individuals may hold. If Ms Wood has positions that she holds that may differ from the government, that is entirely reasonable.

                          Is this really the best you can do midway through a sitting week? Honestly. We have an incredible candidate who has been appointed to a senior job in the economic portfolio, the first time a woman has held it and this is the level of question we get from the opposition. I would say that we intend to take note of the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                           Productivity Commission
                          </a>
                          's reports unlike those opposite, where the decade they were in power had the worst productivity outcomes in 60 years. Get that—60 years. That is what you did. And part of the problem was, every time the Productivity Commission released a report, you ignored it. It sat on the shelf. You didn't even bother responding to it. We look forward to working with Ms Wood. We look forward to her leadership and the skills that she will bring to the economic debates in this country.
