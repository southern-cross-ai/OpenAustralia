         The opposition will be supporting these amendments, which go to drafting issues in the bill. All I will add is that of course these are not the only drafting issues identified in the bill. Through the committee process, as articulated by Senator Scarr and Senator Shoebridge in their contributions, it is our view that those other drafting issues should have also been addressed at this opportunity, but that is a matter for the government. If they don't think these are problems and they think that they won't materialise in practice, then we hope they're right and we will be supporting these amendments.

            , as added by this Schedule, does not apply in relation to an act done, or a practice engaged in, before the commencement of this item.
           </p>
           <p>
            As we noted in the second reading contribution, the amendments to the Privacy Act that have been presented by the government, which are going to be agreed, are going to create a one-size-fits-very-few penalty regime where the only penalty available to the regulator is a minimum maximum, if you like, of $50 million for a penalty and then potentially a higher penalty if a corporation has a turnover that would trigger the higher penalty. This amendment seeks to put in a new section 13GA into the Privacy Act, which would provide that an entity contravenes this subsection if the entity doesn't act and or engages in a practice that is in interference with the privacy of one or more individuals, and it seeks to retain the existing civil penalty of 2,000 penalty units for that breach. It also has a consequential amendment that provides that there's no retrospectivity in relation to that proposed provision.
           </p>
           <p>
            The proposed new section 13GA would remove the necessity for 'repeated or serious' from the offence provision and provide for what pretty much every stakeholder said we need, whether it was Electronic Frontiers, Digital Rights Watch or even the business reps who came before the inquiry that we had: put in place a tiered approach. If the Greens amendment was successful, it would allow the regulator to have at least some nuance in how the regulator goes about enforcing privacy. But if they see a breach of the privacy laws—and it may well be a quite disturbing breach; it doesn't have to be serious or repeated, but it could be—then instead of having to go and press the nuclear launch button of the $50 million penalty they'd be able to seek a penalty that has a maximum value of some 2,000 penalty units for a corporation which would not see small or medium businesses or charities potentially going to the wall when the regulator takes action.
           </p>
           <p>
            Without this, we're going to see no realistic way of enforcing the privacy laws against small and medium business or against the charitable and not-for-profit sector. If the only tool to hand for the regulator is a $50-million-plus maximum penalty, that is not going to be able to be used in any practical way against small and medium business or against
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
             NGO
            </a>
            s and the not-for-profit sector; it just won't be. And we're going to pass a law here today that is actually going to mean less real power, less real capacity for the regulator to enforce our privacy laws.
           </p>

             The Greens
            </a>
            amendment fills that gap. It puts in that tier, which is a realistic penalty that could actually be used by the regulator, who would therefore have a meaningful way of keeping our data and our privacy safe. Without this, let's be clear, the regulator won't have the resources for 99.9 per cent of privacy and data breaches, and it definitely won't have the political will to whack an entity with a $50 million maximum fine. It just won't happen. This is about sensible, measured, nuanced regulation. It's what pretty much every stakeholder said we should do with this bill, and I commend the amendment to the Senate.

             As Senator Shoebridge is aware, this issue is being considered more broadly as part of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act" rel="nofollow">
              Privacy Act
             </a>
             review, and that's why we will be opposing the amendment at this point in time—so that the review can do its work.
            </p>
            <p>
             The powers that are currently available to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
              Information Commissioner
             </a>
             in this area are based on an enforcement-pyramid approach to regulation. The act initially relies upon the Information Commissioner encouraging compliance, and then there are determinations and enforcement in the courts if that is not successful. For the most egregious interferences with privacy, section 13G of the act provides for the Information Commissioner to take civil penalty action against the entity in the Federal Court.
            </p>
            <p>
             The question that the review is considering is whether the regulatory options available are too limited to target the different levels of seriousness with which interference with privacy occurs. The review is considering two additional categories of civil penalty provisions that cover less serious conduct than that in section 13G but that still might warrant enforcement action. The first new category would be a new mid-tier civil penalty for any interference with privacy, with a lesser maximum penalty amount. The second new category would be a series of very low level civil penalty provisions for administrative breaches of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APP" rel="nofollow">
              APP
             </a>
             s, with attached infringement notice powers for the Information Commissioner.
            </p>
            <p>
             Given these proposals are about creating entirely new civil penalty provisions, it's appropriate that these issues are considered thoroughly as part of the review. However, the increase to the maximum penalty of the existing provision of the act which we are in the process of putting through this chamber is a targeted amendment to ensure the maximum penalty available reflects the fact that it is the most serious enforcement action that can be taken by the Information Commissioner where there has been a serious breach of privacy.

             <p>
              While the opposition supports, in principle, the amendments moved by the Greens—and in fact included a similar call for such a regime in our second reading amendment which the chamber has just agreed to—as I articulated in my speech in the second reading debate, we are concerned about and we should not be doing complex amendments to complex legislation like this on the fly in the chamber. There is a risk of unintended consequences.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do welcome the minister's statement that the government will consider this as part of their wider reforms. That is important, because Senator Shoebridge is right; it will be very difficult to apply a $50 million penalty to a very small entity, and it will be very difficult to apply it in the instance of an inadvertent breach rather than a serious one. We are concerned about that—and industry and stakeholders and third-party groups in the inquiry process made that very clear, as Senator Shoebridge has explained to the chamber. But, as a matter of principle, we think the government are in the best place to address this issue, with the access to drafting resources and expertise that they have through the department.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only concern I want to finish on and put on the record is that that process not take too long. If too much time elapses between the passage of these increased penalties and the more comprehensive privacy reforms that the government is talking about, I think Senator Shoebridge is right that we won't have made any meaningful improvement to the cybersecurity and privacy of Australians. It is important that that more comprehensive reform come forward as soon as possible to address these wider and more complex issues.

               I thank the minister for the contribution. I note the minister said there is a pyramid of enforcement measures. If it is a pyramid, it is absolutely built on sand, with minimal actual enforcement measures. Most of us, if we're honest, would accept that cranky letters, rude notices or angry reports from the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
                Information Commissioner

               have not worked in the past to keep our privacy safe, and those kinds of existing remedies will not work, going into the future, to keep our privacy safe. So, if that's the pyramid the government thinks has any kind of utility or use, I think reality and what everyday Australians are feeling on a day-in, day-out basis with the privacy breaches they've been suffering would suggest otherwise. That being said, I do acknowledge the government has now given the commitment to move to have a tiered approach, which is what I understand the minister was saying, that the intent is to deliver a tiered approach which will give some capacity for the regulator to actually use the powers. But I would be interested to know from the minister what the time frame is to deliver that tiered approach, because the longer we go without it the longer we go in basically having lawless provisions. That is, no real, enforceable provisions for privacy.

                  I'm probably not in a position to make that commitment at this point. I know that the review and the report will be also considered by cabinet, so I guess it will be a matter for cabinet as to what is publicly released.

                   On a different point, if I may, to the minister: is it the government's intention that the concept of benefit in the proposed new subsections 13G(2) and (3) is a net benefit or is it any benefit that would trigger the provisions of 13G(2) to (3)?

                      It's a little difficult to comment on any possible hypotheticals that you are putting forward, but obviously it would be a matter for the court to determine whether a company has had a benefit and whether its actions or inactions warrant any type of penalty.
