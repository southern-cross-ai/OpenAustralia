         Thank you, Senator Henderson, for your question. This morning I had the opportunity to join the National Rural Women's Coalition for their annual rural and regional women's muster, here in Canberra. It is a very opportune time to acknowledge the crucial role of rural women in Australian communities on this
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
          International Day
         </a>
         of Rural Women. In the 2019 muster there are 12 indomitable women. They literally cover the length and breadth of this country—from Richmond in Tasmania, from Mantung in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         , from Geraldton and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_River" rel="nofollow">
          Margaret River
         </a>
         in WA, from Yulara in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         , and even from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Norfolk Island
         </a>
         . They bring diversity to their engagement with us in Canberra and they are bringing forward the views and the voices of rural women. We had a great conversation, it was particularly moving in parts, including on the challenges of drought for them and for their families, on mental health, on isolation and on a range of other factors.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to especially acknowledge today the representatives of rural women's organisations who have been joining me at women's stakeholder round tables in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , Queensland and Tasmania in recent months, because they bring a distinct perspective to women's safety, economic empowerment and leadership issues. We are very committed to supporting rural women and girls in succeeding. Our Women's Economic Security Statement, which is backed by $151 million in funding over the four years, includes a number of measures that support rural, regional and remote women and girls. I particularly love the Future Female Entrepreneurs Program, which will engage around 55,000 girls in around 50 face-to-face workshops, as well as young women nationwide, via a digital platform. It is the digital platform that so helps to enable girls in rural, regional and remote areas to also engage in the program and tap into the 100 pieces of original content videos and articles.

            I can, and I want to acknowledge Senator Henderson's leadership as a woman from regional Australia who has joined us here in the Senate following the experience of the House of Representatives—she has come from the other place—and I note her great leadership in her own community, particularly around Geelong. The Women's Economic Security Statement includes measures that support rural, regional and remote women's workforce participation. They are measures like Career Revive, an initiative that gives tailored business improvement assistance for regional employers to recruit and retain women who are seeking to return to work after a career break. The first intake of those 10 businesses was selected just in August of this year.
           </p>

             Development Program
            </a>
            we are funding small-scale and one-off grants to specifically support rural, regional and remote women. There are two great examples I want to mention today: the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Women's Leadership Forum, an annual one-day women's leadership forum in Kalgoorlie where high-profile speakers discuss leadership; and, most recently, our commitment to CatholicCare Wilcannia-Forbes—

               This is one of the most challenging areas not only for government but most importantly for the families and communities that experience violence, particularly in relation to women and their children. We are proud to have made the single largest Commonwealth investment, an amount of $340 million, to support the Fourth Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022. The plan has a deliberate focus on responding to diverse perspectives, including rural women, through National Priority 3 in particular: 'Respect, listen and respond to the diverse lived experience and knowledge of women and their children affected by violence.' Through the Fourth Action Plan, we also have invested $64 million in 1800RESPECT, and it is nationally available to women across Australia through telephone counselling and online support. That includes projects to improve accessibility for people from vulnerable and diverse cohorts, including, of course, coverage of rural, regional and remote locations. There is more to do, but these are important steps.
