         It seems that even after the election the trigger words are still there: the Andrews Labor government. Sorry, I didn't mean to say Andrews Labor government. I thank the senator for the question. I know that he is a proud Victorian. I would hazard a guess that he personally voted for the Andrews Labor government on the weekend. Trigger warning: there are lots of references to the Andrews Labor government in this answer. I should really give you a trigger warning.
        </p>
        <p>
         On Saturday the Victorian community came together and emphatically endorsed the Andrews Labor government and their agenda for Victoria's future. I would like to congratulate Premier Daniel Andrews on his success and the significant achievement of a third time in government. Despite what you may have heard in this place last week, it's clear that the Victorian community has strongly endorsed the work that Premier Daniel Andrews and his team have done to date, as well as the work to be done over the coming years. This was despite an increasingly desperate and personal scare campaign run by the Liberals and Nationals both in Victoria and in the federal government.

            It is always good to talk about the Andrews Labor government. The Albanese Labor government will continue to work with the Andrews Labor government on infrastructure projects throughout the state of Victoria. Through the 2022-23 October budget we have gone line by line through the previous government's mess of an infrastructure portfolio and cleaned it up, while making sure we continue to invest in important projects for Victoria's future. We have put an end to the fake financing and ideological obsession with the East West Link. We are working with the Andrews Labor government to invest in the Barwon Heads Road upgrade stage 2, the Ison Road overpass, the

            rail link, the Gippsland rail line upgrade, the Camerons Lane Interchange at Beveridge and, of course, the $2.2 billion to the Suburban Rail Loop that will be delivered by an Albanese Labor government and the Andrews Labor government.

               I am very pleased you asked about the Suburban Rail Loop, which was a core commitment of the Andrews Labor government. The Suburban Rail Loop is a once in a generation infrastructure project that will transform how Victorians move around the state.

                     Again, I thank the minister. Minister, has the Victorian community expressed a view in relation to the delivery of the Suburban Rail Loop by the state and federal governments?

                      In fact, Senator Ciccone, it's clear from the results of Saturday night that the people of Victoria have yet again made their view clear on the Suburban Rail Loop. Not once but twice this year alone, communities in Melbourne's east have voted emphatically in favour of this project. Whether it's Bayswater,

                      or

                      </a>
                      on Saturday night, or Chisholm and Hotham back in May, local communities have made it clear that they want the delivery of the Suburban Rail Loop.

                      You really would think that the Victorian Liberals would have seen the warning signs after the 2018 election, when Victorians backed in the Suburban Rail Loop—but no. It's like a rail line with a big 'danger ahead' sign, and Senator Henderson and her friends just charged on. It happened again in the federal election, when a government that took the Suburban Rail Loop to the people was backed in. But again Senator Henderson, Senator Van and Senator McKenzie couldn't hear the warning signs. And now they've driven the coalition train off the track—a massive derailment. Stop digging; we've got tunnelling machines to dig the holes for the rail line! We don't need you digging, but you will keep doing so.
