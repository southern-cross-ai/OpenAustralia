        My question is to Minister Payne. In an official press release on 20 February 2015 former defence minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Andrews
        </a>
        said the future submarines would be delivered in the 2020s. Noting that departmental advice has not changed in the last three years, will the minister now confirm that the government's policy has changed and delivery is required in the early 2030s?

           In fact, what I think should be placed on the record is the capability that the Collins class submarine is currently demonstrating and the work that it has done. We have, if not five, definitely four boats currently in the water of the six boats in the fleet. In fact, there are two off

            South Australia
           </a>
           . We value very much the role that the Collins class submarine plays. However, recognising that it will, as all good things, come to an end, we have commissioned through the competitive evaluation process—

             In the context of how the minister was answering the question, I think she was being directly relevant. She has been talking about the Collins class submarines. I think we have to give her the opportunity to complete answer.

              , who I think has recently commented favourably on their activity as well. But we recognised, unlike those opposite, that decisions had to be made in relation to the acquisition of future submarines, so we commissioned a competitive evaluation process.

               … the longer the Collins submarines are kept in service, the more their relative capability will decline as newer submarines enter service within our region.

                Unfortunately Senator Conroy's efforts to mischaracterise the statement I made in the Senate in 2015 are completely without foundation. It is a statement of fact that the longer you extend the life of a capability the more it involves greater sustainment costs. They become more expensive to maintain. It does mean that their relative capability declines as newer submarines enter service within our region. That is a statement of fact.

                  That is a statement of the obvious—indeed, Senator Brandis. The work that we are doing to commence the competitive evaluation process is something that was not done on the other side. That is what would have left Australia with a capability gap.
