         I'm keen to get a few answers in relation to the amendments that you've just moved. They relate to the change in position of the government from proposing an F4 prescription model for vaping products to an F3 pharmacy model, which is something that has happened in the later stages of this bill and subsequent to its passage in its previous form through the House of Representatives.
        </p>
        <p>
         Minister, I'm keen to understand: in the last sitting period, the House of Representatives put through a version of the bill, and you are now seeking to amend the bill quite substantially. Who did the government consult with before making the decision to move to the pharmacy F3 prescription model that is currently being proposed by these amendments?

          These are government amendments that have come out of good faith consultations, Senator Ruston, with the crossbench. These amendments strengthen the laws and clarify the intent that has always been in the laws to return vaping to its original state of purpose of helping hardened smokers to quit by cracking down on the commercial sale and supply of recreational vapes while ensuring that those people who really need a therapeutic vape to help them quit can get one.
         </p>
         <p>
          We've also listened to feedback generally about how important it is for people to have quick access to a quit consultation with a healthcare professional when they seek it. We know that a pharmacy is often the most accessible place people turn to when they need health advice, especially in remote and rural areas. After a 10-month period of having those quick conversations with their
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
           GP
          </a>
          , we will expand the range of healthcare professionals who can have those conversations and recommend whether a therapeutic vape is needed to include pharmacists. I am conscious of the media commentary around the changes, but we do have the support of thousands of pharmacies across the country in relation to this. This has been a long process, one that Minister Mark Butler has worked diligently on with the health sector, the AMA, GPs and pharmacies, so we are prepared to move these amendments.

           I note you made the comment in your contribution that thousands of pharmacies around Australia support your change from an S4 to an S3 model. How many pharmacists did the government consult with before changing its mind around this model and moving to an S3?

              It has been public consultation, very much been on the record. We've seen that through the Senate and the processes that have gone through the parliament. The consultations that have taken place across the country have been very clear through what I've said here and what the minister has said in media interviews.

                There's no doubt, since this came in as a discussion at the end of last year and even as early as this year, that this was going to be a very difficult task but one that was necessary for our country in terms of ensuring the safety of children in particular. So the conversations, the inquiries and the meetings, as I outlined in my initial response to you, have been fully on the record. That's all I have to say on it.

                  We are in constant conversation with the pharmacy sector and with the medical fraternity more broadly across the country. There is a very complete understanding of the machinations of the parliament and the differences that different parties may hold on particular pieces of legislation. They trust that those conversations we have as political leaders with those political parties will still take on board the issues that those areas and those sectors have raised with us. This is not a surprise. This is something that has been clearly supported, and the minister is very confident in that support.

                    stood beside the minister for health only a month ago, and Trent Twomey said:

                    … Australia's 6,000 community pharmacies stand ready, willing, and able to work with both the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments to not only keep vapes out of the hands of our children … but also to increase the accessibility of smoking cessation alternatives.

                     Just to be very clear: are you telling this parliament, this chamber, that the Pharmacy Guild of Australia supports the decision of the government to move to an S3 model for the sale of vapes in Australia? That's what you appear to have just said, although I don't think you specifically and explicitly said that, but I would like you to advise this chamber: have you ever had receipt from the Pharmacy Guild to say that they support your decision to move to the S3 model? What you've just described was a commentary from Mr Twomey when an S4 model was before this chamber and was the government's policy. Have you any evidence whatsoever to substantiate your claim that the Pharmacy Guild support the decision of this government to change their position about the need for a

                      Senator Ruston, your question was in relation to consultation with the pharmacy and Pharmacy Guild, which is what I responded to. In terms of your specific question about whether there is support now, I can certainly take that question on notice as to whether the minister has something in writing, and I'm more than happy to get back to you on that.

                       Just for the sake of being absolutely clear about what I'm talking about here, I am talking about a decision that was communicated to the Australian public on Monday that a deal had been reached between the government and the

                        Australian Greens
                       </a>
                       to move the model by which Australians can access vapes from requiring a prescription from a
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

                       </a>
                       or a nurse practitioner to no longer requiring that. The requirement now, according to the government's amendments to this legislation, is that pharmacies around Australia will be asked to supply vapes to Australians without a script, and they will also be required to be the disposal point for vapes once they've been used. Now, this is a significant change in what has been out as public consultation. The exposure draft of the bill for the entire time that it out in community consultation was predicated on a prescription model, and that prescription model is something that has been in place in Australia for a very long time. What we've seen is a significant change.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I want to make it very clear, minister: you are conflating two issues that are not the same. I'm asking you about the change of position by the government that was announced to the Australian public on Monday. I'm not talking about consultation that happened prior to that. I'm not talking about what guild may have referred to or commented about, or about the previous position of the government. I am very keen to understand what has transpired prior to the decision of the government to agree with the Greens to change the model of prescription, dispensing and disposal of vapes in Australia that was announced on Monday.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       It's pretty clear, if you read the media over the last two days, that the Pharmacy Guild and the Pharmacy Society of Australia do not want to sell vapes. They do not want to be the disposal units for used vapes. They've made it very clear. While I understand that you're not the minister and you can only report what you have been advised from the senior minister in this place, I think it is very disingenuous for the government to suggest that the pharmacies across Australia are supportive of the decision by the government to do a deal with the Greens to change the way vapes are available in Australia. But what is worse than this is, despite your preparedness to admit to it, the Pharmacy Guild, the Pharmacy Society and the 6,000 businesses that make up our frontline community pharmacists around this country did not know anything about the deal that you had done with the Greens until they saw the release from the Greens on Monday afternoon. On Monday afternoon the Greens made a release to say that they had done a deal, and that was when Australia found out that you were going to change the mechanism through which vapes were going to be made available in Australia. Subsequent to that, pharmacies have come out and said they don't want to sell. They say it's completely unworkable, and there are a whole heap of concerns that are now coming out, because there has been no consultation with the pharmacy sector.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Once again, we have got a government making a policy change that affects 6,000 small businesses around the country, and they haven't even bothered to speak to them. They have not bothered to speak to them, they have not bothered to hear their concerns, they have not even bothered to think through the logistical implications of doing this. Minister, what is the maximum quantity of a vaping product that a pharmacist can supply to a patient in a single transaction?

                        I think the only ones who are being disingenuous here, Senator, are the Liberals. Where have you been in the last six months in any of these consultations? We are so close to getting this piece of legislation across. You know, and every single senator on that side who is going to oppose this knows, how important this is to our country, especially the health of our children. You also know, from the answers that I provided here, that we have had continuous discussions with the Pharmacy Guild, with pharmacies, with

                                      Well, you know, I think what we're asking here is: how well trained are pharmacists? I think that's almost an insult to the intelligence of pharmacists across the country. They fill prescriptions for lots of medications—hundreds and hundreds of medications—across the country for different treatments, and I'm sure they're more than capable of understanding how much a month of supply is.

                                       Under most prescribing arrangements, the pharmacist would be given information on the quantity of that prescription. For instance, pseudoephedrine has a requirement of the quantity that can be supplied in that period. So I'm just interested to understand what training is going to be in place for pharmacists, particularly when the pharmacy sector have already been very clear that they don't want to do this anyway because they don't believe that it fits in with the role that they play in the community. So, whilst I do absolutely respect the extraordinary professionalism and health knowledge of our pharmacists, we're talking about a completely different thing here. So, once again, I would like to understand: if somebody walks into a pharmacy and they are allowed one month's prescription, what does that entail? How are the pharmacists supposed to be able to meet the legal obligations of supplying a month?

                                        . My response was that we are working closely. One of those areas where we are working closely obviously is this particular point about the guidance that's required for pharmacies to be able to know what to do in terms of the month prescription.

More specifically, is the minister aware of concerns regarding pharmacies' liability or professional indemnity if they supply unregistered products without a prescription?

                                          Senator, I think you would know that they would all have indemnity insurance and would be aware, whether it's around vaping or any of the other products that they provide to customers. I'm just trying to work out where you're trying to go with this line of questioning when we know that it is a general practice of pharmacists to be across all of these concerns.

                                             ():  What I need to understand is whether the government has itself sought to understand whether existing indemnity and liability insurance is sufficient to cover the requirement of pharmacies to provide and supply these particular products. Has the government been through the process of understanding whether there is any liability that's attached to an insufficiency of professional indemnity insurance to cover the supply of vape products, given the nature of vape products? Has the government sought to satisfy itself that there is no problem?

                                              Thank you, Senator. I am certainly advised, and I know that, from your previous role as a minister, you know that when pieces of legislation go through all of these processes are checked through, including indemnity and looking at liability. They are part and parcel of what we try to do in the scrutiny of any piece of legislation that comes before the Senate.

I'm just trying to understand what your questioning is, when we're talking about pharmacies having the ability to do this. I'm not sure if I've misunderstood your question; please correct me if I have.

                                                   I'm keen to understand what the physical requirements of the pharmacy are in terms of point of sale. For instance, if e-cigarettes can't be stored where they're visible to the public—often they need to be stored in lockable cupboards or whatever—are there any point-of-sale requirements that are specific to the sale of vapes?

                                                         You may not be able to answer this because it actually came from the press release of the Greens. It was really clear in the Greens' press release that the agreement reached between the Greens and the government was that, when somebody purchased vaping products through a pharmacy under this particular mechanism, their details, including their name, would not be recorded. I accept that you've taken my question on notice. Right now, under Queensland law, as an example, a pharmacist must attach a label to a schedule 3 medication—a label that includes the details of the person that is purchasing it—and the pharmacist is required to keep that information for two years. I'm interested to understand the inconsistency between the announcement that personal details would not need to be recorded and the fact that, under Queensland law, they are required to be recorded.

Clearly there will always be different points of view, but I would encourage pharmacists who are listening across the country, to please get on board and assist our government to go ahead with this world-leading piece of legislation that will make a difference to the lives of families across our country.

What we will need to do over the next couple of years is, obviously, get data. Then we will be able to understand the usage—what's happening with the pharmacies, our schools and our children in relation to the sales of vapes—and understand what kind of data we will need to then be able to have a very thorough review.

Most particularly, we do not want a thriving black market to continue, which is what we know that we have under the current arrangements. To this end, Minister, could you advise where the Illicit Tobacco and E-cigarette Commissioner is and when they are due to commence their role? That was a previous commitment of your government about six months ago under previous legislation.

We are very aware of the concerns around the black market. To deal with that issue and the possibilities that it could impact we've provided funding, resourcing, of an additional $25 million to the Australian Border Force and $56.9 million to the TGA over two years. We don't go into this thinking there will be no black market. We recognise that we have to deal with the realities here. So, that's our way of ensuring the enforcement around that, and we sincerely hope we can see the details through this over the next couple of years.

It's my understanding that e-cigarette products must not be visible to the public from anywhere inside or outside a retail shop. You can temporarily open a storage unit if a customer asks for a specified e-cigarette. What are the provisions, the discussions with pharmacy, around making sure they have these particular storage units? I understand we're going to stay with the prescription-only model until October. But, as of October, who will be required to pay for these? And what consideration or consultation has been undertaken with pharmacies as to how they are physically supposed to be locating these? Also, could I seek some confirmation—previously you said it would be up to the discretion of the pharmacist as to how they stocked and displayed vapes in their store, yet it seems quite clear from this that pharmacies, or anyone, have a requirement for them to not be visible to the public.

You gave an example of vapes being next to the baby Panadol. So, I was using the word 'discretion' in terms of examples like that, where I think a pharmacist would know where they should put the vapes—maybe not next to the baby Panadol. So I want to be clear on that point, if I can, given the example you provided in the question.

I said at the outset that we've engaged in conversations right from the get-go in terms of wanting to see this legislation come to fruition. That means working with the Pharmacy Guild. It means working with the pharmacies across Australia, the pharmacy sector, the AMA and the medical sector. These are ongoing conversations. For the clarity of the Senate, I want to make it very clear that the minister continues to work with all of those areas in the medical fraternity.

We've got an example from Queensland about having to record names and stick people's names on products for schedule 3 medicines. The Victorian government, as I've just pointed out, requires e-cigarettes to not be visible and to be stored in lockable containers. There's almost a juxtaposition. You're saying, 'We respect the discretion of the pharmacies and their professional health authorities,' and I absolutely think our pharmacists are fabulous, but they have legal requirements. They are the laws of the states and territories of Australia. They have a legal requirement to comply with the laws of those states. Yet you are not giving me any response.
                                                                                        </p>

                                                                                         So we have to have non-visible, lockable containers in which vapes must be stored and the only time they can be opened is to actually get the vape out and sell it to the customer. Who is going to be the one responsible for these particular storage units? Who is going to pay for them? What discussions have been had with the pharmacy owners—not pharmacists but the pharmacy owners—about actually doing something? It's but one of the practical implications that exist around dropping a policy like this on the sector at the very last minute. I would reiterate that we're talking about 6,000 largely small businesses around Australia who are the front line of primary care in this country. You and I both come from rural, regional and remote Australia, and we both know they're often the only health professional in town. Who's been working with these people to understand what the consequences of this are, and who is going to pay?

First I would like to remind the Senate that this is a collaborative arrangement. I said earlier that every chief health officer across the country has supported this. We are supported by each jurisdiction, and it will be up to each jurisdiction to work with the pharmacies in those areas. Clearly the 6,000 pharmacies that we know are across the country will need the support and assistance of the departments of health right across each and every state and territory jurisdiction. So there is a body of work that has to go through in terms of that coordination.

Our government has said, from the moment that we came into office, that tackling vaping in this country was going to be critical, and we continue to work with the states and territories and the pharmacies across the country to ensure that this legislation does work and is effective.

I think that's probably the most obvious response to that—if families can feel that their kids are no longer addicted, that they're no longer vaping in places they shouldn't be and they're no longer using it. Okay, that's a very anecdotal and personal response, but I think it's still a very relevant one. This impacts families across the country, and it impacts teachers trying to work with their students.

That's how we will measure. In addition, the government is using a range of resources and data to monitor the impacts of the vaping reforms over the short and longer term. It's important to note these reforms include a series of different regulatory activities, many of which are yet to be implemented, and these reforms are part of a broader suite of regulatory and non-regulatory measures being implemented by all Australian governments to reduce rates of vaping and smoking. We have commenced work with states and territories and other key partners to develop an evaluation program, including outcome indicators to monitor progress—and the work of the states and territories is absolutely critical to the success of these reforms—and the development of nationally agreed monitoring and evaluation activities, including agreed measures of success.

In your previous contribution you said, 'This hasn't just happened overnight.' What has happened overnight is the change in position in relation to the mechanism for supplying vapes in Australia. That has happened in the last few days. Up until Monday Australians were unaware that vapes will be available in pharmacies, without a prescription, if the legislation gets through this place, so I would say that this has happened overnight. It has happened overnight because, for some reason, the government decided that they wanted to do a deal with the Greens. I don't know why the government decided that they needed to change their position. I have to say: the government has been absolutely rock-solid in its obsession with sticking with the prescription-only model, up until a few days ago.
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                             The coalition has always taken the view that restricting and prohibiting children's access to vapes is the No. 1 priority that should be delivered through legislation in this parliament, and we do not shy away from that. We merely differ in our belief about how that is best achieved. At the end of the day, the coalition believes in being honest with the Australian public, and the mechanism through which vapes are currently available is plainly not working. It is not stopping children from getting access to vapes. I don't think there is anybody in this place that doesn't believe that if they walked out of here, no matter how old they were, they could walk into a store somewhere in Canberra and buy a vape. That has been no different over recent times, and following this legislation it will still be no different.
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                             What we question is the need for you to have gone and done a deal with the Greens under the cloak of darkness, without any consultation with he very people it's going to impact—the very people you expect to implement this change of policy: Australia's 6,000 small-business pharmacies around the nation. I think it is not correct to put on the record that this hasn't happened overnight. The change has happened overnight. I will absolutely concede that the government has been pursuing a prescription-only model since it came into government. It had not been pursuing a pharmacy dispensed model until Monday. Or they may have been pursuing that, but the public was unaware of it and the very people who have to put it in place were unaware of it until Monday.
                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                             I would say that what we have before us here is one of the most confusing deals I have ever seen, the need for which I have yet to see. We have a completely unworkable solution now being put on the table. We have a whole heap of our frontline health professionals, our primary healthcare workers, our pharmacists, not wanting to have anything to do with this particular change in plan, and yet the government sit here and somehow pretend that they have been consulting with Australia's pharmacists about this particular change.
                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                             It is very disappointing that we are sitting here today. We are going to see a messed up change. It is just creating great confusion across the country. There is no consistency in what's gone on here, and yet the government seems to think that it's okay to do some deal with the Greens at the last minute and confuse all of Australia. It's very disappointing, Minister, that in all of the conversations that we've had this morning we don't seem to have got any understanding about the practical implications of a last-minute policy change for one of the most important parts of our health system and a part of our health system that is under immense pressure. We all know that primary care is under immense pressure at the moment. Now we've just turned around and blindsided pharmacies once again. This is a track record of this government. They did it last year when they decided without any consultation that they were going to bring in double dispensing. We've seen the result of that particular action. It has hardly delivered any real benefits in terms of the cost of medicines to Australians.
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                             Here we are, once again, having a debate about something that has been a knee-jerk policy decision of the government under the cloak of darkness without any consultation with the sector that is now required to implement it and no consideration of the costs. We have heard nothing in response to any of our questions about what the government's intentions are in terms of the additional cost burden on our pharmacies of implementing this policy. So it is very, very disappointing to be standing here. We will certainly not be supporting the amendment that they have put forward.

Before I do, I just want to clear up a couple of things at least from the Greens perspective and as a member of the committee which conducted the inquiry into the bill.
                                                                                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">

                                                                                              </a>
                                                                                              were very supportive of the bill going to inquiry so that the committee had the opportunity to give feedback on the bill. One of the processes that we as a committee go through is identifying the witnesses that we believe need to be called to give evidence before the inquiry to enable the various ramifications of the legislation to be fully understood. When we sent out our list of invites for witnesses to give evidence to the committee, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia was on that list. They as an organisation then formally declined to give evidence to the committee. Their declining to give evidence came back to us as committee members and I prioritised a further request to the guild that they give evidence to the committee precisely because I wanted to ensure that the views of the guild in relation to the bill or any proposed changes to the bill were clearly understood and that they had the opportunity to give their views on this legislation. They did not take that opportunity.
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                              So, in my role as health spokesperson for the Greens, I took a meeting with the guild as to their view on the legislation. In that meeting, they articulated that their preferred approach to this area of policy was not to have vaping products listed under schedule 3, which is a perfectly legitimate position for them to put to us in their capacity as a peak body. What I cannot cop and what I must use this opportunity to call out is the argument that the opposition of the guild to schedule 3 is based around a concern that the substances may not be appropriate for use under schedule 3 because they, in the view of the guild, are not safe. Let me say very clearly: the view the guild put to me and my team in our meeting was that they would support schedule 4 of these substances or they would support schedule 2 of these substances. They did not support schedule 3. So to come into this debate and propose that they oppose this scheduling because they are concerned about the safety of the substance is very disingenuous, given that schedule 2 would have made it easier for young people and adults to access vaping products. It would have made them an 'in front of the counter' substance without the requirement to engage in a therapeutic conversation with the pharmacist or to demonstrate proof of age. There's a lot that I will cop in this debate, but I will not cop that perspective from the guild, and I think they need to be more transparent with the Australian public in relation to this debate.
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                              I also want to put on the record that we sit here today about to pass one of the most significant public policy reforms of this parliament. It is historic, what we are about to do. We are about to establish a world-leading scheme to tackle a serious area of public health concern, and I pay tribute to my incredible team, who through the course of this legislative debate, through the course of our consideration of the government's proposal, have demonstrated the most incredible capacity to engage with a complex policy area, to negotiate among many varied perspectives, to bring the community into the conversation and to ensure that the legislation's details were fully understood and known. I thank them for their incredible dedication and work in this area. I specifically acknowledge that this has taken a lot of time—as it should, commensurate with its importance—but I think it is really vital, as we get to this moment today, to acknowledge that, while the people officially on the other side of the golden bar, you would hope, played a role in getting the legislation to where it is, there are whole teams of people who have also given up their weekends, their evenings and their days off to get this to where it is today. We as MPs have a responsibility to ensure that the public has a clear view that what we contribute to these spaces is the product of the team's collective work.
                                                                                             </p>

Minister, under this legislation, what does the government expect will be the threshold of reasonable suspicion a police officer will have to meet to conduct a search of a person?

Search-and-seizure powers are not given under the TGA act, and this is a matter for the states and territories. Our amendments strengthen the bill and ensure individuals will not be criminalised. The government has been clear since we began undertaking our vaping reforms that we are not setting out to punish or criminalise individuals who use vapes. We have, rightly, always treated vaping as a public health issue first, and the bill and its explanatory memorandum make this clear, indicating that offence provisions are not intended to be used against individuals but rather against commercial actors.
                                                                                              </p>

                                                                                               The government's amendments to the offence provisions—which we have developed with your party, Senator Steele-John—after the application of the offence set out under proposed section 41QD of the bill. This offence will now apply to retailers in a retail setting who possess less than a commercial quantity of vaping goods, ensuring that the offence specifically targets commercial actors. Similarly, the offence set out under proposed section 41QC—possession of greater than a commercial quantity of vaping goods—now includes an exemption for individuals who hold up to five times a commercial quantity of vaping goods, provided they are for their personal use and were legally supplied.
                                                                                              </p>

It goes to the core of the intention of these reforms, and I'm pleased we have been able to work together to ensure that the bill more closely reflects our intentions in this regard.

                                                                                                Minister, I have a couple of questions on how this policy will be evaluated, but, firstly, I would like to say—Senator Ruston was making this point—that this bill has changed substantially over the last week. We're essentially considering a vastly different bill to the one that was on the table last week, and it's disappointing that stakeholders weren't given more time to consider these changes.
                                                                                               </p>
                                                                                               <p>
                                                                                                Since the details of the bill were released earlier this week, the overwhelming message I've received directly from medical professionals and public health experts is that this is not ideal. As was mentioned, the Pharmacy Guild don't appear to support these changes, despite being the ones who will be the most impacted through this new model. I wonder if, at any time, the Greens asked the pharmacy profession, the medical profession or the public health community how they felt about what was being proposed and what emerged earlier this week on the new model that's on the table.
                                                                                               </p>
                                                                                               <p>
                                                                                                I don't disagree with many of the changes that have been made, but I know that legislation is strongest when there is rigorous debate, scrutiny and buy-in from those who need to implement it. Clearly, leaving the current policy settings in place isn't an option. The current system, which was put in place by the former government, has undermined our public health. It's been a public health disaster. It's led to an explosion of underage vape use and illegal sales and has created a new generation of nicotine addicts in Australia.
                                                                                               </p>
                                                                                               <p>
                                                                                                The alternatives we are offered today are to do nothing and continue with the current model, which is not working, or to wait for the coalition to develop a policy on retail sale. Let's be clear: a retail model will develop a new generation of full-time vapers, leading to full-time smokers. I think it's an appalling way forward. We know that tobacco use causes lung cancer, which is still the leading cause of cancer death in this country, despite all the work that has gone into reducing smoking. At the same time, tobacco increases the risk of stomach cancer, throat cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer and bladder cancer. It also causes heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. It suppresses your immune system. It can contribute to hearing loss. There's excellent research showing that vape use puts young people on a path to tobacco use; you can't separate the two. I don't think any parent wants vaping or tobacco for their child.
                                                                                               </p>
                                                                                               <p>
                                                                                                It took the world a long time to grapple with tobacco—it took decades—and we saw lots of delaying tactics. Many lives were lost. Most of us will know someone who smoked and ultimately faced the health consequences of that. While vaping leads to tobacco use, we also don't know the long-term impact of vaping. We know only that the chemicals within vapes are harmful. With this in mind and with the options on the table, I will be supporting the amendment and the bill.
                                                                                               </p>
                                                                                               <p>
                                                                                                It is critical that we do not create a new generation of nicotine addicts. If we can stop it before it starts, we will be saving lives. I would love to see us as a parliament taking this longer-term view on legislation—actually looking up to the young people who are coming through this building and getting a view on democracy that is meant to represent them. But so often we're so focused on the next election that we're not willing to do the hard things to protect them. When it comes to things like climate change and having a duty of care to young people, as well as housing and actually addressing some of the root causes of the housing crisis, we've got to be looking longer term.
                                                                                               </p>

I know that tremendous effort has gone into getting the legislation to where it is and I certainly hear your thoughts there in your statement. There's been lots of data collected and reported already, by AIHW and ABS, as you would know, and what I've said previously in committee is that the legislation commits us to undertake an independent review of the bill and associated instruments within three years. The reason for that is that we need to be able to collate data over that period of time. You're right, election cycles have a habit of interfering with all sorts of things. That's just me throwing that in, but I am conscious that that timeframe is important. I also want to reassure the Senate and the parliament that that independent review will take place as part of this piece of legislation.
                                                                                                </p>

It's important to note that these reforms include a series of different regulatory activities, many of which are yet to be implemented, and that these reforms are part of a broader suite of regulatory and non-regulatory measures that are being implemented by all Australian governments to reduce rates of vaping and smoking. Clearly, the support of our state and territory counterparts is absolutely essential to ensure that this legislation is successful right across the country. We can't do this on our own, and that requirement of the states and territories is going to be critical, especially in the coming months as the minister meets with the respective health ministers of each state and territory jurisdiction.
                                                                                                </p>

The work, as I said, of the states and territories is absolutely critical. We want to work to end recreational vaping. We need to ensure that those hardened smokers who really need a therapeutic vape to help them quit can get one. Most smokers quit without any nicotine replacement tools, but if a hardened smoker finds the resolve to walk into their local pharmacy and say, 'I want to quit,' then we want that pharmacist to have a conversation with them, then and there, and be able to offer the gum, patches or therapeutic vape that might help that smoker give up for good without having to refer them to a

We think that 1 October is an appropriate date for this improved access to take effect. It will allow time for the rigorous systems, protections and oversights to be established, while also ensuring that access is improved before March next year, when the price of tobacco products will rise and a whole range of new smoking protections will see new graphic warnings and changes to the look of cigarettes, tobacco products and packs to make them more dissuasive and less appealing.

I say to all Australians and those involved in this piece of legislation: thank you for the work that you've done to enable us to put this before the House and before the Senate. It is, as many senators have said, world-leading legislation. I thank all senators for their involvement.
