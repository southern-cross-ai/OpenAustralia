        was condemned by anti-poverty organisations and advocates as being 'disturbing', 'abusive' and 'inaccurate' for saying out loud how Liberals like her view people trapped in poverty as huge cost centres, as an underclass of Australians who are neglectful parents and almost entirely lacking in discipline. Minister, as another Liberal minister, will you join me in condemning her appalling statement and abuse of some of the most vulnerable people in our community?

         Just before I call the minister, interjections are always disorderly, particularly during the asking of questions. If you want everyone in the chamber, particularly me, to hear the question, then I do need some silence.

Unquestionably, that is our single purpose and role.

              I reiterate my initial comments. I am not going to make a comment about something that you're saying, but I will absolutely guarantee to this chamber, unequivocally, that my absolute focus is making sure that the resources of my department and the resources that are provided by the taxpayers of Australia are there to support vulnerable Australians and to make sure that we support them when they find themselves in situations, whether it be when they are unemployed, whether it be when they're victims of domestic violence. Whether it be supporting the states and territories in their frontline service provision or in the case of child protection and the like, the absolute focus of my department is always to support the most vulnerable people in our community. That is why we have always been so tremendously focused on not only creating jobs but actually working with Australians to get them out of unemployment.

                One of the key things to have come out of many of the reports—some released this week and others that have been released around this particular issue—is that we know that people who are on unemployment benefits do it way tougher than those people who have a job. That's why we're so focused on getting them into work.

                  Minister, poverty is a political choice. Last year your government increased income support during the lockdowns, but this year hundreds of thousands of people have lived through lockdowns on payments below the poverty line, going without food and without medicines and being at risk of homelessness. The removal of COVID disaster payments means thousands more people are now joining them. Minister, do you agree that the JobSeeker rate of $44 a day is not enough to live on?

                   No government has done more to walk side-by-side with Australians, supporting them through this COVID pandemic. We have supported Australians, whether it be through increases in the JobSeeker payment last year, whether it be through the COVID disaster payment that was administered through Senator McKenzie's department to support those people in Australia who have found themselves in the lockdowns of recent times, whether it be through the business supports that have been put in place. But we also understand that, as a government, we have a responsibility to maintain the sustainability of payments that are made. We have to make sure that we support people in a safety net—

                         As I was saying, the obligation of government is to make sure that these sorts of payments are sustainable into the future. We have to balance supporting people when they find themselves out of work. But also, we have to make sure that the incentive is there for them to go to work. That's why we create jobs, and that's why we are the government.

Why are you going after people on income support but not taking on the big corporations that profited billions of dollars on JobKeeper?

                            Firstly, we need to be very clear around the fact that any fraudulent activity in relation to any payments that are received, no matter who they are received by—whether it be businesses or individuals—is always pursued by government. Where people have received something they are not entitled to, it is our obligation, as the custodians of taxpayers' funds, to pursue that. When we put these things in place we were very clear to make sure people understood that, if they were receiving JobKeeper, they were required to declare it as income. If you go onto our website it is very clear that that is earnings and you have to declare those earnings. We will pursue anybody who has received taxpayer funding when they have not been entitled to it.
