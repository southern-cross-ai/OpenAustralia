         I thank Senator McKenzie for her question and her very passionate support for rural and regional education in particular. I commend her for her leadership, over a long period of time, of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, which she has just stepped down as being chair of. We welcome Senator Reynolds to that role. In regard to rural and regional education, the Turnbull government recognises the profound importance of providing support to regional education. Regionally headquartered universities received almost $1.8 billion in base funding for Commonwealth-supported students in 2017, and this is projected to grow by over $2 billion by 2021. Around 50,000 extra students from rural and regional Australia have participated in higher education since 2009, which demonstrates the growing participation rate and the closing of some of the gaps in higher education participation for different equity groups. Under the Turnbull government's higher education reforms, rural and regional students will continue to benefit from the investment of $592 million over the forward estimates in the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program, which supports low-

         , Indigenous and, particularly, regional students in their participation. It will enshrine the program in legislation to ensure that universities focus on providing the support students need and that they have the capability to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
         Students in the regions will also benefit from the investment of more than $280 million over the next four years, through regional loading, to support the cost of educating students in regional and remote Australia. Rural and regional students will also benefit from the extension of the demand-driven system to sub-bachelor places, which will give rural and regional students greater opportunities to access and engage in the course that best suits them. They will also benefit from a proposal to establish up to eight new community owned regional hubs across Australia. These hubs, which will improve access for regional education students within their communities—

           Thank you very much, Senator Birmingham, for your continued advocacy for equity in education for all Australians. Can the minister advise the Senate how the Turnbull government's higher education reform measures will benefit students, taxpayers and the Australian economy?

               That $17 billion will grow over the next few years, with funding growth of 23 per cent forecast for universities over the next four years under the Turnbull government's reforms. This, of course, is providing good, strong levels of funding. We're also taking action to ensure that it is more sustainable for the future as well. It's funding growth, but at a slightly slower rate than forecast in recognition of the fact that universities have seen 70 per cent growth in their funding resource since 2009. That's far in excess of economic growth and far in excess of revenue growth. We recognise that, with the growth in student loans as well, there is absolutely a capability for universities to ensure productivity gains and efficiency gains, as has been identified by former vice-chancellors and experts in higher education, who recognise the capability for there to be more sustainable—

                  With the growing funding that universities will receive and the record base, we are also determined to ensure that universities are accountable for that and particularly accountable for ensuring that their graduates have relevant skills, have appropriate support and are graduating in disciplines with the support to get a job and succeed in the workforce. That's why the Turnbull government proposes that there should be a stronger performance system in relation to the funding of Australian universities. An element of funding ought to be tied to the performance of universities in terms of them adhering appropriately over time to the right types of admissions practices, the right support for their students through the duration, the quality of the education they provide and the outcomes of those students in terms of getting a job and guaranteeing the benefit that accrues to students from their university education. For the autonomy and funding universities enjoy, we think it is a small price to pay that there should also be some performance contingency to that funding to guarantee success in the future.
