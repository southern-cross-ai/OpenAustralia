         I wish to raise as a matter of public interest Senator Sinodinos's statement of private interests. As senators may recall, Senator Sinodinos entered the chamber in the dying moments of the previous sitting week to confess to omitting several company directorships from his statement of private interests, and to attempt to clarify his very murky dealings with the increasingly infamous company known as Australian Water Holdings. Not only was this a cynical attempt from Senator Sinodinos to deflect attention away from his dodgy dealings but it is not how—

             Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator has now explained why it is she is reflecting on Senator Sinodinos. She used the phrase 'dodgy dealings'. That implies impropriety, and you should, applying the standing orders, require her to withdraw that imputation. If it were said outside this chamber it would be plainly actionable.

              <p>
               Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. What I was about to say—and to remind Senator Brandis, as he full knows—is that this is not the way the Senate usually deals with personal explanations. But I will come to that in a moment.
              </p>
              <p>
               It was, however, a remarkable confession, received with great scepticism by senators on this side of the chamber. Senators would be aware of the significance of honouring the very important obligation to maintain a complete and accurate statement of private interests. Holding office as a senator is a privilege that carries with it an obligation to behave at all times with the utmost integrity and to act in the public interest. I am sure that none of my Senate colleagues would argue with this very important statement of principle, even those on the other side of the chamber. I am sure we would all agree that a critical component of our ethical obligations is making a full and frank disclosure of our private interests so that the Australian people can have confidence that our private interests do not conflict with our official duties as senators.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is indisputable that those who hold leadership positions ought to be held to an even higher—I stress, an even higher—standard than normal. Senator Sinodinos, for example, is the shadow parliamentary secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, a position of great trust. The Australian people expect those of us who are privileged to hold such positions to lead by example, and they will rightly condemn us when we fail to conduct ourselves appropriately. Political life is littered with sad tales of those who lost office because of impropriety, maladministration or indeed misconduct.

                Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator has now plainly reflected on Senator Sinodinos. She has accused him of impropriety and dishonesty. I take you to standing order 193, substanding order (3):

               <p>
                it is not possible to dispute that the words Senator Collins has used are offensive—

               <p class="italic">

               </p>
               <p>
                the senator herself used the word 'impropriety'—
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                and all personal reflections on those Houses, members or officers shall be considered highly disorderly.

               <p>
                Senator Furner, I am inviting you as a neutral chairman to rule that the assertion of impropriety against the senator, which was Senator Collins's very word—

                   On the point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, I was listening to Senator Collins's contribution and have just listened to the first point of order that Senator Brandis raised and to his second point of order—I was listening very carefully. Of course, Senator Brandis would be right if a senator had been accused of impropriety; that would be disorderly. But, as I heard Senator Collins comment, I would respectfully suggest that she used words to the effect—I cannot say I can recall precisely the language used, but they were effectively words to the effect—that 'political life is littered with examples of impropriety'. That is the context in which Senator Collins used the word 'impropriety' and I suggest that it is actually a statement of fact. If it were applied to a senator or, as Senator Brandis says, to any member of a house of parliament in this country, that would be disorderly. But I think that in the context it was used it was not disorderly. I tend to be a stickler for these sorts of things, so I would respectfully make that submission to you on the point of order in this case.

I was on my feet to do that and I was going to assist you by pointing out that, when the opposition accused Senator Conroy, the

The time limited for Senator Macdonald to address you had not expired. No senator had objected to the remarks made by Senator Macdonald, but you of your own volition, at a time when a senator was within his time period and not out of order, simply brayed at him—

                               I have a new point of order. Senator Furner, when you ruled, as you did a moment ago, that I should sit down, I had not finished addressing the point of order that I was raising. In fact, I had not even made my point of order. You sat me down without ruling the point of order not to be a valid point of order, and therefore you prevented me from exercising my rights as a senator to make a point of order and, further, you did not discharge your obligation as the presiding officer to deliberate on the point of order. Senator Furner, I have no objection—no senator could have any objection—to the presiding officer ruling the point of order out of order, but you did not do that. First of all, you did not hear the point of order; secondly, you did not deliberate on the point of order; and, thirdly, you did not rule the point of order out of order.

                                          The new point of order, Senator Furner, is this: when you indicated in response to my previous point of order that you had in fact given a reason, the reason you then recited did not relate to the point of order I had taken. It related to an earlier point of order on which you had already ruled. So I ask you to give the reason for your ruling on the point of order taken by me most recently before this, which you have not ruled on.

                                           Senator Brandis, I think I have covered off in terms of the point of order I made in regard to the earlier point that was made. In terms of what you were discussing subsequent to that point—it was a matter in terms of sitting you down—I made the decision on that basis due to the fact that there was no time limit, as you were referring to in your point, and it is not a matter of time to have that point of order relate. Therefore, they were the grounds on which I sat you down.

                                            It seems as if Senator Brandis's ailments from question time are extending into other components of debate in this chamber, because Senator Brandis needs to listen to what I actually say rather than what he fears I might say. So I will repeat the point that, roughly, Senator Faulkner relayed quite correctly. The point I made is that political life is littered with sad tales of those who lost office because of impropriety, maladministration or misconduct. So I suggest that Senator Brandis actually listens to what is being said here rather than what he fears is occurring and not interrupt the debate for 10 minutes with spurious points of order.

                                               Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Senator Macdonald raises one example, but perhaps I could give him another. Senator Bernardi, Senator Sinodinos's predecessor as shadow parliamentary secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, resigned from this position after admitting that he had failed to meet the standards of conduct expected of those holding high public office.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               The circumstances of the Senator Sinodinos's confession are very concerning and they leave several important questions unanswered. Senator Brandis, I am not seeking to answer those questions or, indeed, imply what the answer may be. I am raising before the Senate that there are many unanswered questions.
                                              </p>

Not only is he hearing things that have not been said, but now he is anticipating his fears, not through any question that I have raised that makes any imputation, but that I might. This is just absolutely ridiculous. You are time wasting and you should allow us to continue with this debate.

Senators should ask themselves whether Senator Sinodinos's last-minute confession complies with both the letter and the spirit of the requirement to fully and frankly disclose their private interests.

You just heard Senator Collins say, 'Senators should ask themselves whether Senator Sinodinos's last-minute confession complies with the letter or the spirit of the standing orders.' Although dressed up as a question, that is plainly an imputation and I ask you to rule accordingly that it is a reflection on a senator in flagrant breach of standing order 193(3).

Senator Sinodinos's decision to execute this mea culpa in this regrettable fashion robbed the Senate of the opportunity to promptly address his behaviour, because the Senate did not sit again, as we all know, until approximately a week and a half later. I have heard it remarked that this was a cynical and manipulative measure, but I will leave that to the commentariat to reflect on.

Accusing a senator of 'feigning' something is the same as saying that a senator is lying. You cannot construe it in any other way. In relation to what was a very serious, sober and thoughtful contribution by Senator Sinodinos, saying that Senator Sinodinos was feigning something is a reflection on him.

That is how many casualties there were during that time.

This is a scandal that has haunted Mr Santoro to this very day, and I would not be surprised if it remains burned in the memory of Senator Sinodinos. It has been reported that Senator Sinodinos, as John Howard's chief of staff, was intimately involved in responding to the ethical crisis that Mr Santoro's regrettable behaviour sparked within the coalition. In these circumstances, I question whether anybody could sincerely expect the Senate to believe that Senator Sinodinos is ignorant of private interest rules. Further to this let us consider the detail of the multitude of company directorships that mysteriously slipped Senator Sinodinos's mind. These are not just a couple of not-for-profit directorships as suggested by Mr Abbott. That simply does not stand scrutiny. First we have Senator Sinodinos's directorship of Move to Live Pty Ltd, which the senator described as a healthcare company. I believe there are unanswered questions about Senator Sinodinos's involvement in this company. These are serious questions indeed and they relate to the much-maligned Santo Santoro

Senators may be interested to learn that the now-infamous Mr Santoro,who, as I previously mentioned, was forced to terminate his own political career as a result of drastic failings of judgement, was also a director of this company. Senators opposite complained, but indeed I am not even quoting the former

But, I return to Senator Sinodinos. It turns out that Senator Sinodinos and Santo Santoro sat around the Move to Live board table. Why did Senator Sinodinos fail to mention Santo Santoro's involvement in this company? Given Santo Santoro's own history with private interest matters, are we to believe that Senator Sinodinos thought Mr Santoro's involvement was not a legitimate matter of public interest? Was Senator Sinodinos concerned that revelation of his involvement with Mr Santoro would raise damaging questions about his own political judgement? Was Senator Sinodinos trying to hide something? Is Senator Sinodinos hiding any other aspect of his involvement with Move to Live or the operations of the company?

As Senator Brandis is fully aware, this is not the first time that Senator Sinodinos has been caught out exercising poor judgement and establishing murky associations. The committee of privileges—

Senator Collins, in breach of standing order 193(3), reflected upon Senator Sinodinos by saying this was not the first time he had been caught out, implying wrongdoing in relation to murky associations. The assertion 'caught out' implies a person has been exposed in wrongdoing. That is plainly a reflection on the senator.
