        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for

         National Commissioner
        </a>
        for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children and Young People to help finally achieve progress under Closing the Gap. Target 12 under Closing the Gap concerns removal of

        report. Currently no entity holds responsibility for overviewing the implementation of the report recommendations. Is the new commissioner intended to be responsible for this overview?

         I thank Senator Thorpe for the question. I will come back with further information if I'm not able to fully answer the question that you've asked. The commissioner's work will be focusing on reducing the number of children in out-of-home care, strengthening families and keeping children and young people safe. An interim commissioner will begin work midyear. Resourcing is obviously being provided for that. As you say, there have been a number of reports into child protection since the

         report in 2007. I think the feedback that the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians

               I will come back to Senator Thorpe if there is more information than I am able to provide her today, but one of the points I made was that there have been a number of reports, including the
               <i>
                Bringing them
               </i>
               <i>
                home
               </i>
               report, which have a number of recommendations, and certainly I would believe there's an expectation that the commissioner is looking at all of those recommendations, and that would inform the work that needs to be done. This is an area that has been fraught for a long time, the issue generally of child protection across the community but particularly for
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
                First Nations
               </a>
               children in out-of-home care and how to provide appropriate support to them and their families and put in arrangements to support them as best as they can. I know that from experience, being a child protection minister for a few years. If there is more that I can provide, Senator Thorpe, in terms of how they would implement the recommendations, I will bring that back.

                  Certainly there has been assessment of resourcing for this role that will be provided. The government will, of course, make sure that those resources are available for the commissioner to do their work and adequately resource them to do their work. That goes without saying.

                      We have assessed the costing for the commissioner. I said I would come back with further information, if I had it, about the resourcing for oversight of recommendations.

                         will work with that commissioner to ensure the scope of their responsibilities and to make sure that we are consulting with relevant stakeholders about it.

We remain committed to reducing the number of children in out-of-home care and supporting First Nations families, particularly those that have contact with the child protection system.
