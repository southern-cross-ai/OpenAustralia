         We made a very clear commitment in the lead-up to the last election that if we were elected in 2013 the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
          GST
         </a>
         would not change. We are, absolutely, standing by that commitment. What we are also doing is engaging in a discussion on how we can strengthen the Australian economy further. In order to ensure that the Australian economy is as strong as it can be and we create a better opportunity for people to get ahead and get a job we need to have a growth-friendly tax system.
        </p>
        <p>
         After we got rid of Labor's disastrous mining tax, after we got rid of Labor's disastrous carbon tax, after we gave a company tax cut to small business and after we decided not to go ahead with Labor's bank tax we have, as we always said we would, initiated a discussion and a consultation, in good faith, with the Australian people and with the states and territories about how our tax system could be further improved to strengthen growth. Guess which state government leader was one of the earliest to suggest that we should look at the GST: it was the then Tasmanian Labor Premier
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Giddings" rel="nofollow">
          Lara Giddings
         </a>
         . Go and ask Lara Giddings. When she was coming to Canberra for more money for the state government in Tasmania, for health and education and the like, the Tasmanian Labor Premier Lara Giddings was suggesting that the federal government look at the GST.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are working, in good faith, as we are developing our agenda for stronger growth that we will take to the next election, on how we can improve our tax system to make it more economic-growth friendly. That is a responsible course of action. That is what any good government would do. The Labor Party are going into a desert of negativity. We have the Leader of the Opposition trying to run a scare campaign, which has scared all of the Labor people, but we are not scared on this side.

           As the good senator would know, federal government funding for health, education and pensions continues to increase. The age pension is going up twice a year. Every six months the pension goes up. Do you know what else is happening? Every year, the Commonwealth government is putting more money into state hospitals and state schools. What this government will continue to do, as part of our focus on stronger growth, more jobs and giving everybody the best opportunity to get ahead, is ensure that our spending at a federal level is affordable and the economy is sustainable. We are not making any apology for making sure that the important expenditure on the social safety net and on health, education, national security, defence, border security and so on is affordable over the medium to long term. We know that the Labor Party keeps putting their head in the sand. You stay there—it's a good view, isn't it?

             The Turnbull government is focused on doing everything it can to strengthen growth and strengthen the opportunity for everyone across Australia to get ahead. Over the last two years, this government has implemented a strong growth agenda. We got rid of Labor's lead from our saddlebags—the mining tax and the carbon tax. We reduced red tape costs for business by $2 billion a year. We are pursuing an ambitious free trade agenda, with free trade agreements with Korea, Japan and China. We are pursuing an ambitious infrastructure investment program—
