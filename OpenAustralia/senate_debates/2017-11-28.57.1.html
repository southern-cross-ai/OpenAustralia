         Thank you, Senator Steele-John, for your question. I well recall from my period as the minister for disabilities that, if you were an Australian with a disability, you were twice as likely as other Australians to be unemployed. There are a number of things that the government is doing to help improve the levels of employment of people with disability. I should obviously at the outset mention the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Although it is not an employment scheme per se, the supports that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         gives individuals, which are matched with the needs that they have, will put many Australians in a better position to consider entering the workforce and to do so. That can be from some very straightforward things,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , that you and I might take for granted but which can be impediments to people engaging in the workforce.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's at a general level. More specifically, the government has the Disability Employment Services Reform, and in the 2017-18 budget we included a comprehensive package that includes significant reforms to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DES" rel="nofollow">
          DES
         </a>
         to help more people to keep and find jobs. The government will continue to invest over $3 billion in the DES over the budget and the forward estimates. These reforms follow extensive sector consultations in 2015 and 2016 and seek to improve the overall performance of the program through which currently around one-third of participants remain employed three months after a period of assistance. But, clearly, we do want to do better.

           The low employment rate of people with disability in Australia means that one in two Australians with disability live in or near a state of poverty. With Australia ranked last out of the 27 nations of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
            OECD
           </a>
           for people with disability living in poverty, I ask the minister how he would justify Australia falling so far behind the rest of the world in terms of poverty and supporting people with disability.

               I wasn't indicating anything about feeling. I was making the policy-related point that, as a government, we are not satisfied with the level of unemployment, and I know there wouldn't be a colleague in this place who was. As I was about to say, the best thing that any government can do for someone with a disability who is unemployed—or someone, whoever they are, who is unemployed—is to help create the circumstances for them to have a job.

                  There's absolutely no debate on that point, which is why, from 1 July, the reforms that we'll be introducing will improve participant choice and control through the

                   DES
                  </a>
                  , engendering competition and contestability in service delivery, improving incentives for providers to place jobseekers in employment, and introducing indexation to provider payments and a trial of expanded DES eligibility for students in the last year of school. Obviously, we do have arrangements in place for the disability support pension, as that is there as a provision for people who do not find themselves in a situation where they can obtain work. But we have the disability support pension, the DES program and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We always want to work to improve and refine these arrangements so that we can see more Australians with disability in work.
