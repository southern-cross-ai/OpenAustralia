       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the Senate and, in particular, the whips for facilitating the committee's statutory requirement to table this report within the 15-day disallowance period. The committee's review examines the minister's decision to list this organisation. Section 102.1A of the Criminal Code provides that the committee may review a regulation which lists or relists an organisation as a terrorist organisation and report to both houses of parliament before the end of the applicable 15-day sitting disallowance period. The report I am presenting today serves this purpose and is being presented within the required period. Hizballah's external security organisation has been listed as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code since 2003. Regulations that specify an organisation as a terrorist organisation cease to have effect on the third anniversary of the day which they take effect. Organisations can be relisted, provided that the minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act, or advocates the doing of a terrorist act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hizballah's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESO" rel="nofollow">
         ESO
        </a>
        has been relisted six times since 2003, and this will be the seventh time. Each time the relisting of Hizballah's ESO has been reviewed, it has been supported by the committee, as it has been in this case. In examining the evidence that has been provided, the committee is satisfied with the listing processes and consider that they have been followed appropriately for this organisation. There is a long history of attacks around the world attributed to the ESO, including the 2012 bombing of an Israeli tourist bus in Bulgaria, which killed six people. Last September, a dual Australian-Lebanese citizen was convicted in absentia for his role in this attack. Given this, the committee is in no doubt that the government's decision to relist the ESO under division 102 of the Criminal Code is appropriate and finds no reason to disallow the regulations.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, the committee was concerned by the decision to, at this stage, only relist Hizballah's ESO. In its last review of the relisting of Hizballah, in 2018, the committee recommended that the government consider extending the listing to include the military wing of Hizballah. In this report, the committee goes a step further. We recommend that the government consider listing Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist organisation. We do so based on the expert evidence received by the committee that the distinction that we currently draw between Hizballah's ESO and the rest of Hizballah is arbitrary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Matthew Levitt, a world-renowned expert on Hizballah, told the committee that there is no plausible intellectual case to distinguish between the ESO and the rest of Hizballah, who he described as a 'singular, unitary organisation'. As he noted, it is a distinction that Hizballah itself explicitly rejects. In his submission, Dr Levitt quoted
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naim_Qassem" rel="nofollow">
         Naim Qassem
        </a>

       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's position listing only the ESO as a terrorist organisation is increasingly isolated internationally. Twenty-two countries and two regional organisations list them in their entirety, including: our

         Five Eyes

         United States and Canada
        </a>
        ; like-minded countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan; and Arab countries and groupings, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates" rel="nofollow">
         United Arab Emirates
        </a>
        , Bahrain, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Cooperation_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Gulf Cooperation Council
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League" rel="nofollow">
         Arab League
        </a>
        . Other like-minded jurisdictions, such as the European Union, France and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        , at least extend their listing beyond the ESO to include the military wing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The military wing has in the past provided training and operational support for other organisations prescribed as terrorist entities by Australia, such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad" rel="nofollow">
         Palestinian Islamic Jihad
        </a>
        and Hamas' al-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qassam_Brigades" rel="nofollow">
         Qassam Brigades
        </a>
        . Given this evidence, the question for the committee was: should Australia continue to persist with the fiction that the ESO is a discrete entity within Hizballah? There are practical reasons that we should not. One case of concern to the committee was that of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Haidar" rel="nofollow">
         Ali Haidar
        </a>
        , a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        man convicted of violent offences who escaped being classified as a high-risk terrorist offender, as sought by police, because a judge said it was not clear that his express support for Hizballah was for the External Security Organisation or simply the political wing. Justice Davies noted:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        accepts that Hezbollah maintains a militia and that it had deployed forces in Syria to assist the Syrian regime. Notwithstanding, the Commonwealth did not list Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation. In my opinion, it would introduce confusion into the area of anti-terrorism if the Court were to reach a different conclusion …
       </p>
       <p>
        As the deputy commissioner of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McCartney" rel="nofollow">
         Ian McCartney
        </a>
        , told the committee, if an organisation is not listed as a terrorist entity by the federal government it does make it more difficult for them to investigate and prosecute someone for terrorism offences, because they are also required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that an organisation is a terrorist organisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee does acknowledge that if its recommendation to broaden the listing of Hizballah is accepted by government there will be practical implications for some agencies. We do not lightly dismiss the evidence we received about these challenges, including in a classified hearing. However, based on the evidence we received in both classified and public hearings, we believe that these challenges can be mitigated if carefully implemented. In particular, the committee was comforted by the statement by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        director-general
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Burgess" rel="nofollow">
         Mike Burgess
        </a>
        at our public hearing that 'listing the entire organisation would not impact ASIO's ability to do its job'.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee was also informed by the experience of the United Kingdom in its listing process for Hizballah. Like Australia, for many years the UK listed only the External Security Organisation. But in 2008 it widened its listing to include the military wing, and in 2019 it did so to all of Hizballah.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK" rel="nofollow">
         The UK
        </a>
        home secretary who made that decision,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajid_Javid" rel="nofollow">
         Sajid Javid
        </a>
        , said at the time:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There have long been calls to ban the whole group with the distinction between the two factions derided as smoke and mirrors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Hezbollah itself has laughed off the suggestion that there is a difference. I have carefully considered the evidence and I am satisfied that they are one and the same, with the entire organisation being linked to terrorism.
       </p>
       <p>
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Government have continued to call on Hezbollah to end its armed status; it has not listened. Indeed, its behaviour has escalated; the distinction between its political and military wings is now untenable. It is right that we act now to proscribe this entire organisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Crucially, in evaluating the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK's" rel="nofollow">
         UK's
        </a>
        decision to do so in retrospect in 2020 Javid also said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The relationship with Lebanon is as strong as ever. The international development program we have, we had to recalibrate some of them, stop one or two of them and invest in others, that work continues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having carefully considered all the evidence presented to it, the committee has recommended that the Australian government extend the listing of the ESO to the entire organisation of Hizballah. The committee has also recommended that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Home Affairs
        </a>
        and other relevant agencies provide the committee with a classified briefing on its response to this recommendation within three months of the tabling of this report. This is to ensure that the three-year listing period does not elapse before further investigation of this matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the committee would like to thank members of the community and international experts who made submissions to this inquiry and gave evidence at a public hearing. The evidence they provided was compelling and was very helpful in guiding the committee's decision in this matter. I would also like to thank my fellow members of the committee for the diligent and considered way they approached this inquiry on a tight deadline. The PJCIS is rightly recognised for its bipartisan approach to national security issues, and this inquiry is a perfect example of how powerful that can be in the service of the national interest. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later.

           I note Senator Paterson's remarks and endorse them and associate myself with them. For those who may be following this discussion, I note that the report that we are tabling here is being tabled in a somewhat unusual circumstance, given the hours motion that is before the Senate today. So I'll keep my remarks short, and I do appreciate that Senator Paterson sought leave to continue, because I imagine that other members of our
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
            Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
           </a>
           may also wish to speak. But I feel, given that we are tabling the report here today, that it's appropriate that the Senate and the public take note that the report that is being tabled today is bipartisan and unanimously supported by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.
          </p>
          <p>
           I particularly note the two aspects of the report that Senator Paterson has pointed out: (1) to endorse the relisting of Hizballah's External Security Organisation as a terrorist organisation, and that was supported by the committee, and (2) the two recommendations to the government in the second chapter of the report that in particular go to the very question Senator Paterson was just examining, and that is whether or not there is any distinction between Hizballah's External Security Organisation and the other wings of the organisation. Again, I make clear that this is a bipartisan report, unanimously supported. In recommendation 1, the committee recommends that the Australian government give consideration to extending the listing of Hizballah's
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESO" rel="nofollow">
            ESO
           </a>
           as a terrorist organisation to the entirety of Hizballah, noting the position of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League" rel="nofollow">
            Arab League
           </a>
           , the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Cooperation_Council" rel="nofollow">
            Gulf Cooperation Council
           </a>
           and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates" rel="nofollow">
            United Arab Emirates
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           I know that Senator Paterson made mention of this. But I think it's important to recognise the evidence we received from Dr Matthew Levitt, particularly in the context that, if the government does seek to accept this recommendation and consider extending the listing of Hizballah to the entirety of the organisation, it would be important to have outreach to the Lebanese diaspora community in Australia. This is an important tool that the Australian government could use to help this community understand the impact of any change in the listing of Hizballah. Dr Levitt told us that he didn't know of any country that had done anything like that in advance, and it would be really useful. He went on to say that it would mean having a plan in advance to be able to explain specifically why we are doing this and how it is that this is not against all of Lebanon, all Lebanese or, very importantly, all Shia people. I note that the committee chose to include that in their report. It's also noted in the report that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
            Department of Home Affairs
           </a>
           has advised the committee that the engagement that it's had with the Australian Lebanese community has not, to date, included a discussion of the implications of listing Hizballah's ESO as a terrorist organisation. I would just note that the committee would certainly encourage and welcome that, if Home Affairs were to take that step and take on board Dr Levitt's advice.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lastly, I would like to observe that the committee was concerned that the Minister for Home Affairs's submission to the inquiry made no mention of the committee's previous recommendations from the 2018 report and did not provide adequate evidence as to why only the ESO should continue to be listed. Hence, the importance, the committee believes, of the parliament, through the PJCIS, being briefed on the outcomes of their recommendations in this report, providing a fundamental accountability mechanism, particularly given the weight of evidence we heard from submitters in terms of both our national security agencies and members of the community, particularly the Australian Jewish community. So, in doing so, I thank Senator Paterson for his leadership, particularly on his careful consideration of this difficult issue. It is important that we act in the national interest in a bipartisan way to keep Australians safe. With the careful consideration of this report, I believe, we have come to an appropriate set of recommendations. I encourage all in the parliament and the community to consider the recommendations. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
