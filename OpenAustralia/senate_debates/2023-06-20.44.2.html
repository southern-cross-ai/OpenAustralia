        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Gallagher. Minister, in response to a question regarding whether a brief or any form of advice was ever provided to you or to your office on the claim or proposed settlement as envisaged by guidance note 7, you said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        From my memory, I did not receive a brief or any advice from my department. I think it was quite detailed in terms of any other advice that may have come to the office. I would just want the opportunity to check that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, have you checked whether you or your office received such a brief?

         In terms of whether there was a brief or any form of advice provided to me or my office on the claim or the proposed settlement and as outlined, I think, by guidance note 7, I think was Senator Cash's question, I can confirm that the answer to the senator's question is no.

           In response to a question regarding whether you ever declared a conflict in relation to any aspect of the matter, including the proposed settlement, or if you ever sought advice in relation to a potential conflict, you said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           If it had come to me, I would have declared a conflict, but it didn't. It didn't cross my desk. I did not get a brief. If there is anything further that I can update the Senate about on that, I will.

           Minister, is there anything further you can update the Senate on in relation to this issue?

            No. I refer you to the answer I gave last week and the answer I've just given now. I did not receive any brief, including as envisaged by guidance note 7, so I had no conflict to declare.

              AM (—) (): In response to a question regarding whether you or your office had any communication with the Attorney-General or his office, in relation to the proposed settlement of the matter, you said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              I certainly had no contact with the Attorney-General. Again, just for the purposes of being absolutely clear to the Senate, I will take other aspects of that on notice, because that would require me going and speaking with other people. But, from my point of view, no.

             <p>
              Minister, do you stand by your answer and can you advise the Senate if your office had any contact with the Attorney-General's office in relation to this settlement matter?
