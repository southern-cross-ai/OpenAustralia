           It's the opposition's view, firmly, that the Migration Amendment (Bridging Visa Conditions) Bill should be dealt with today. It is also our view that it should have been dealt with yesterday—or the day before, or indeed last week. And it is our view that the government should have been prepared not just yesterday or last week but last month or the month before that, because the government has known that the High Court was going to make a decision and a ruling on this critical issue. And the government has had indications in terms of comments made from the bench that that ruling may well have gone against them. Yet they have been caught flat-footed. They have not done the preparatory work. It is clear that this government has been dragged to the position of presenting this legislation to parliament.

           the opposition asked where the legislation was and why it wasn't coming forward. We want to see it passed. We will pass it today, but we will scrutinise it and we reserve the right to propose amendments to it.

              Well, here we are. We have had a confected emergency—created by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton; cheerled by the Murdoch media in this country; demonising refugees as creating a threat to the community—which has been blown out of all proportion. And what has the government's response been? To collapse in a screaming heap. The Labor Party's response, predictably, has been to collapse in a heap and let the opposition leader tickle their tummy. Make no mistake: this is Prime Minister Albanese's

              moment. A confected emergency is providing political cover for the Labor Party to engage in persecuting refugees. That's what's going on here.
