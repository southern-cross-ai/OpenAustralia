           funds have been used appropriately, there is an ongoing investigation by Fair Work Australia. They will obviously investigate any matters which they think are of concern or have been raised with them. They will follow the normal processes available to them in pursuing that investigation and taking appropriate action as they see fit. In terms of their investigation, it would not be appropriate for me to comment. But in terms of constant claims in the media about particular instances, clearly that has nothing to do with my responsibilities as a minister. I do not know the veracity of any of that.

            by Philip Coorey citing a senior Labor MP who said that Mr Thomson looked him in the eye and said that he had won his defamation case against Fairfax. Given that Mr Thomson told his colleagues he was 'very happy with' the outcome of the defamation hearing, how can the Prime Minister still say that she has complete confidence in Mr Thomson?

             I note that the senator is very well read in terms of the newspapers articles. I know that is the source of most Liberal Party research, which tends to make question time a bit predictable. I certainly do not intend to respond to allegations that somebody may have told a journalist something. That is clearly not appropriate. As I have indicated previously, I have nothing in my ministerial responsibilities that pertains to the questions asked.
