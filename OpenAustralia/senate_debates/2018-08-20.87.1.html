        My question is to the Minister for Communications, representing the Minister for

        . Minister, I refer you to the 119 children currently in offshore detention on Nauru, and specifically to the case of a 12-year-old boy who is on a hunger strike, who weighs just 36 kilograms. Is it true that doctors have advised your government that the boy is at risk of death within days? Is it true that the reason you have not evacuated him to Australia for desperately needed medical treatment is that you insist that he travel without his family? Minister, why will you not allow his family to travel with him?

         I can't speak about that individual case, but let me just make clear to colleagues the situation on Nauru in relation to children. Firstly, no-one is detained on Nauru, and children can move about the island freely, including attending school. As of 15 August there are 120 minors in Nauru, three-quarters of which remain engaged in the

           The point of order is on relevance. The minister has at least partially addressed the question by saying that he's not going to respond to individual cases. I'm wondering if that constitutes a claim for public interest immunity by the minister, because he has given no reason at all to substantiate that statement.

            All senators know that I cannot instruct a minister how to answer a question. As long as the minister is directly relevant to part of the question asked, he is in order. The minister is being directly relevant to part of the question you asked.

                     Resignation syndrome is a rare psychological condition that afflicts traumatised children when they are overwhelmed by stress.

                              , the point of order is relevance. In my question I asked only about resignation syndrome. The minister is reading out a prepared answer that has nothing at all to do with the subject of my question. I ask that you at least remind him of my question.

                               Senator McKim, you have reminded the minister of the specific nature of your question. I heard the minister. You asked about diagnosis. I heard the minister talking about health. He has 41 seconds to continue his answer. I do believe what the minister was saying was directly relevant, but you've taken the chance to remind him.

                                      . Minister, how much more do the children on Nauru need to suffer before your government will take action? How many families need to be torn apart and ruined? How many children need to die, Minister? Or will you take action now and evacuate these children and their families to Australia? In fact, will you close down your whole bloody offshore detention system?
