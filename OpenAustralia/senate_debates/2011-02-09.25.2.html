        My question is to the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Conroy. I ask specifically whether the government is prepared to extend access to its current loan scheme to businesses which have suffered economic loss as a result of the devastation wrought by the recent floods and cyclone?

         I thank Senator Abetz for his question. The tragedy that has taken place across Australia in Queensland,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , Victoria, Tasmania and in a range of local regions makes all Australians very grateful that our emergency services coped as well as they did. The issue that Senator Abetz goes to is very specific. I would like to have some discussion about the financing of all the assistance packages because Senator Abetz is asking about funding for businesses. We are in the process of providing funding for small businesses in a whole raft of measures.

           , on the point of order, the acting leader was answering the question. One of the difficulties that always arises on this point of order is the way the question is framed. It was not a specific question, it was a general question about loan schemes. It was not in the area of what it is designed to do, that is, the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. Under those arrangements there are assistances to small businesses of up to $250,000 and that is the question that, perhaps, could have been asked but was not asked. To demand a specific answer to the question that was asked is out of order.

            Order! On the point of order, I am listening to the answer that the minister is giving. I cannot direct the minister how to answer the question. I do note the question that was asked by Senator Abetz. I believe that, at the stage the point of order was raised, I thought the minister might be coming to a specific part of the answer. I will listen further.

               . As I was saying, joint state and Commonwealth assistance is being provided to small businesses under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements in disaster declared local government areas. Under these arrangements eligible small businesses and primary producers can access recovery costs and concessional loans. For example, in Queensland, eligible businesses and primary producers can receive concessional interest rate loans of up to $250,000 and freight subsidies of up to $5,000. These arrangements have been extended to 29 local government areas. Eligible small businesses and primary producers can receive recovery grants of up to $25,000 for primary producers, and small business grants are available in 22 local government areas and six partial local government areas. The Gillard government is also providing additional finance assistance.

                , I ask a supplementary question. How much money has the government already given to people described by the Treasurer as ‘low-lifes’ who claimed $1,000 from Centrelink when all they suffered was a power outage? Are businesses that are economically impacted by the floods more or less deserving?

                 You have asked for a very specific number and I am happy to seek further information from the Treasurer to get that very specific number that you have been asking for. Let us be clear, the government is providing an enormous amount of assistance despite the opposition from those opposite who continue to run a cheap political campaign. Maybe the funds that they have raised for their Liberal Party might be donated to those businesses and flood victims across the country who have a genuine need for them. Maybe, just maybe, if those opposite were not engaged in humbug and hypocrisy when it comes to assisting flood victims, cyclone victims and bushfire victims, we might actually have some genuine debate rather than hypocrisy from those opposite.
