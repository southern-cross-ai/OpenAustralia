        The Heavy Vehicle Safety Initiative (HVSI) program funds initiatives that will deliver tangible improvements in road user, road and heavy vehicle safety. The HVSI program, administered by the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator on behalf of the Australian Government, has provided more than $28 million for 117 grants over six years. The Australian Government has committed a further $5.6 million under Round 7 of the HVSI. In previous rounds, grants have been awarded to initiatives to educate road users on appropriate use of rest stops and support management of effluent disposal.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is also making significant investments in road infrastructure to deliver safety and productivity benefits for the heavy vehicle industry. As at the 2021-22 Budget, the Australian Government has committed more than $25 billion over the next four years towards road projects with direct and indirect road safety benefits. This includes direct investments in road safety specific packages.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The $3 billion Road Safety Program (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSP" rel="nofollow">
         RSP
        </a>
        ) is providing targeted lifesaving road safety treatments on rural and regional roads and greater protection for vulnerable road users in urban areas. As an added benefit, the RSP is delivering over 9,000 jobs across all states and territories. The RSP will see safety improvements on state highways, arterial roads and urban and peri-urban roads through the application of various safety treatments to raise the standard of the road.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the $500 million Targeted Road Safety Works Program is providing upgrades across states and territories to improve road safety for all road users. Projects include the rollout of rumble strips, audio tactile markings, shoulder sealing and widening, and installation of safety barriers on high speed undivided roads.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program will provide $607 million funding from 2013-2014 to 2024-25 towards projects to increase the productivity and safety of heavy vehicle operations throughout Australia. This investment is expected to reach $1 billion by 2030-31.

         Black Spot Program
        </a>
        targets those road locations where crashes are occurring by funding measures such as traffic signals and roundabouts at dangerous locations. The Australian Government will provide $1.2 billion to the Black Spot Program from 2013-14 to 2024-25, with an ongoing commitment of $110 million each year following.

         R2R
        </a>
        ) supports the maintenance of the nation's local road infrastructure assets, which facilitates greater accessibility and improves safety, economic and social outcomes for Australians. As part of the Local and State Government Road Safety Package announced in the 2019-20 Budget, the Australian Government committed an additional $100 million per year to the R2R from 2019-20. From 2013-14 to 2023-24, the Australian Government will provide $6.2 billion under the R2R. This investment is expected to reach over $9 billion by 2030-31.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the Bridges Renewal Program, the Australian Government is providing more than $760 million over nine years from 2015-16, with an ongoing commitment of $85 million per year from 2025-26 to upgrade and replace bridges to enhance access for local communities and facilitate higher productivity vehicle access.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government also continues to commit funding towards our major road transport corridors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bruce Highway is Queensland's major north-south road corridor and provides critical linkages for freight movements between inland production areas and 11 coastal ports and major regional centres. The Australian Government has committed over $10 billion to the Bruce Highway Upgrade Program from 2013-14 to 2027-28 to deliver priority upgrades along the route. The projects include major upgrades and realignments, strengthening and widening type works, plus a range of safety and efficiency measures to target poor crash sites and to provide additional overtaking lanes and rest areas. Projects are also aimed at improving capacity constraints, and flood immunity issues along the Bruce Highway's length.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Highway
        </a>
        upgrade - completed at the end of 2020 - was one of the largest road infrastructure projects in Australia. The highway connects Sydney and Brisbane, and is a major contributor to Australia's economic activity. Since the commencement of the Pacific Highway upgrade in 1996, fatal crashes have more than halved, down from more than 40 per year prior to the upgrade commencing, to fewer than 20 in recent years. To support the safety improvements, time savings and reduction in noise and pollution to major towns, the Australian Government committed over $5.6 billion from 2013-14 towards the completion of the Pacific Highway upgrade.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has contributed $683.8 million towards the Monash Freeway Upgrade in Melbourne. Stage 1 of the project was completed in 2018 and Stage 2 will provide additional lanes, duplication of feeder roads and upgrade key intersections, and is expected to be completed in mid-2022. The project is expected to reduce congestion and travel times and increase network resilience on this important freeway corridor.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Also in Melbourne, the Australian Government has invested $50 million towards duplicating 1.4 kilometres of O'Herns Road between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
         Hume Freeway

         High Street
        </a>
        and O'Herns Road. This funding has also delivered a grade separated new diamond interchange at O'Herns Road. This project has improved network efficiency and provided a quicker and safer journey for drivers accessing the Hume Freeway.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government continues to work with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transport_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         National Transport Commission
        </a>
        and state and territory governments to progress the Heavy Vehicle National Law Safety and Productivity Program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These commitments accompany the Australian Government's many initiatives to support skills and training, work health and safety, heavy vehicle road reform, and safe and legal deployment of future land transport technologies including connected and automated vehicles.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does notsupport recommendation 1.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Improving road safety is a national priority for the Australian Government, with responsibility shared across all jurisdictions and at all levels of government, including local government. The road transport industry is subject to the work health and safety (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHS" rel="nofollow">
         WHS
        </a>
        ) laws of each jurisdiction. The Australian Government works with states and territories through Safe Work Australia to encourage national consistency in WHS laws and to address WHS issues of national concern, including safety in the road transport industry.

       <p class="italic">
        The establishment of an independent tribunal to address rates of pay and conditions in the road transport industry has been tried before with negative impacts on owner-drivers, small and family transport operators. The Australian Government abolished a similar body in 2016, the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal (RSRT), following two independent reviews and feedback from industry participants confirming that, while the aim of the RSRT was to improve safety, the use of financial incentives and strict regulation had significant unintended consequences on participants in the sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Economic analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers showed the RSRT's two remuneration orders would result in a net cost to the economy of $2.3 billion over 15 years with no tangible impact on road safety. It also found there was limited and contradictory evidence to show any relationship between safety and remuneration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Within this context, the Australian Government has committed to never re-establish the RSRT or a similar body that sets mandatory rates of pay for owner-drivers and small transport businesses. The Australian Government believes investing in practical measures that support the industry's safe, sustainable and efficient operation, combined with the existing effective regulatory supports, is the best way to ensure the continued viability of the road transport industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the last ten years to December 2021, road crash deaths involving heavy trucks decreased by an average of 2.9 per cent per year. Further, the number of deaths from crashes involving heavy trucks since the RSRT was abolished in 2016 has reduced. This shows the Australian Government's approach is working.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are also a number of avenues already available to road transport supply chain participants to resolve various disputes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the national workplace relations system, the Fair Work Commission (the Commission) is already empowered to resolve disputes involving employers, employees, unions and employer associations. These parties can access the dispute resolution procedures of modern awards, enterprise agreements or the
        <i>
         Fair Work Act 2009
        </i>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FW" rel="nofollow">
         FW
        </a>
        Act). This includes assisting with disputes concerning termination of employment, general protections, workplace bullying, enterprise agreement making, interpreting an award or enterprise agreement clause, right of entry and casual conversion.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         The Commission
        </a>
        is responsible for setting the safety net of minimum wages and award minimum standards for employers and employees including in the road transport sector, and the bargaining framework of the FW Act also provides the opportunity for employers and employees to negotiate employment conditions that are flexible and productive, and meet their individual needs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman is also able to provide dispute resolution services to assist small business independent contractors with various issues, including payment of invoices and other disputes.

         IC

        Act), a party to a 'services contract' may apply to a Court to review a contract on the basis that it is unfair and/or harsh. The IC Act does not define 'unfair' or 'harsh'—these terms assume their common law meaning. In reviewing a contract, a Court must only have regard to the terms of the contract when it was made and other matters at the time the contract was made. This may include the relative strengths of the parties to the contract and whether the contract provides total remuneration that is, or is likely to be, less than that of an employee performing similar work. If a Court is of the opinion that the contract is unfair and/or harsh, then it may set aside all or part of the contract, or vary its terms.

        (which commenced operation on 3 June 2021) provides certain independent contractors and small businesses with an aggregated turnover of less than $10 million legal protection from competition laws to form or join a collective bargaining/negotiating group to negotiate with their supplier or customer about the supply or acquisition of goods or services. Without legal protection provided by the class exemption (or a specific notification or authorisation), collective bargaining/negotiating for goods and services may contravene the

        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This class exemption is available for small businesses in the road transport industry whose turnover was less than $10 million in the financial year prior to them forming or joining the group, and is distinct from collective bargaining for employment conditions under the FW Act.

        Registered industrial relations organisations occupy a privileged position in Australia's industrial relations system. This includes provisions in the FW Act to permit right of entry for trade unions. These provisions have evolved over time to balance the right of organisations to represent their members in the workplace, the rights of employees to receive representation and information from organisation officials at work, and the rights of employers to go about their business without undue inconvenience. These right of entry laws give union officials the capacity to investigate suspected wage underpayment and other issues on behalf of their members, so long as they comply with their permit obligations and requirements under the FW Act and other instruments.

        The Australian Government, state and territory governments and the NTC are working to introduce a regulatory framework for the safety of automated vehicles. In June 2020, Infrastructure and Transport Ministers agreed to work towards establishing a national approach to regulating automated vehicles when they are commercially deployed on our roads ('in-service'). This includes a new national law and regulator, supported by a general safety duty. In February 2022, Infrastructure and Transport Ministers agreed that the national Automated Vehicle Safety Law will be implemented as a Commonwealth law, with the law to be drafted by the end of 2023 and the law and regulator to commence by 2026.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new in-service safety law will create obligations for entities responsible for automated driving systems to ensure they operate safely on Australian roads. This includes establishing safe design and accountability processes. The new national law will be supported by state and territory on-road enforcement activities that will assist enforcement officers to interact with and respond to road safety risks associated with automated vehicles.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In August 2019, Infrastructure and Transport Ministers agreed that jurisdictions should amend their motor accident injury and insurance schemes to cover crashes caused by automated vehicles. This reform will enable people injured in a crash involving an automated vehicle to access an equivalent level of care, treatment, benefits and compensation to that experienced by people injured in an accident involving a vehicle controlled by a human driver. Ministers also agreed to refer decisions on insurance to the state and territory-based Board of Treasurers for endorsement.

The consultation was announced by the Payments System Board on 21 May 2021 and an issues paper was released on 15 November 2021.

        While the Reserve Bank of Australia is the sole issuer of banknotes, it recognises that it is only one participant in the banknote distribution system and is seeking views on what changes to Australia's banknote distribution system might be required to ensure banknote distribution is effective, efficient, sustainable and resilient.

       <p class="italic">
        A new heavy vehicle operator assurance scheme is currently being considered under the Heavy Vehicle National Law (HVNL) Safety and Productivity Program. The new scheme is intended to support a flexible approach to meeting legislative requirements. Industry stakeholders will be closely consulted on a new scheme to ensure it reflects the needs of industry. The Australian Government supports sound regulation, education and operator assurance as appropriate mechanisms to encourage best practice, rather than a rating system which could prove to be anti-competitive.

        Contracts with a road transport component are predominantly entered into by state and territory governments, rather than with the Australian Government. While the Australian Government is a major funding partner for transport infrastructure projects, the planning, design and construction (including procurement) is primarily the responsibility of state and territory governments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        More broadly, procurement frameworks already exist to support robust Australian Government procurements. This includes the Commonwealth Procurement Framework, that requires Commonwealth officials to undertake procurements that are efficient, effective, economical and ethical, as well as offering value for money and encouraging competition.

        In 2020-21, under Round 5 of the Heavy Vehicle Safety Initiative (HVSI), the Australian Government awarded funding to the Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association (ALRTA) to support a project to develop and deliver an awareness campaign to enable stakeholders to better understand how to manage effluent for the Livestock Supply Chain Industry Code of Practice. This follows funding provided in 2018-19 under HVSI Round 3 that awarded ALRTA funding to establish Australia's first roadside effluent disposal facility for livestock carriers and use captured effluent for purposes such as irrigation, soil composting, worm farms and energy generation.

        The Australian Government recognises that a key component of being a safe heavy vehicle driver is fatigue management. Fatigue management is one of six reform areas of the HVNL Safety and Productivity Program. The Australian Government supports an updated HVNL that reflects improved fatigue provisions, but also ensures drivers are not unfairly impacted. The heavy vehicle industry will be widely consulted before Ministers consider policies on fatigue provisions for the HVNL.
