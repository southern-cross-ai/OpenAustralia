        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Prior to the minister imposing a suspension on the export of live cattle to Indonesia, was he aware of a closed system operated by a prominent Australian company that owns its own Indonesian feedlot and A-class abattoir and can guarantee that Australian cattle exported to Indonesia are treated according to acceptable international standards?

        <p>
         The challenge for those on the other side is to ensure that we do two things in relation to the live animal export industry: first of all, ensure animal welfare outcomes when the cattle go to export markets and, second, ensure we have a system in place that provides supply chain assurance. 'Supply chain assurance' means that we can trace, have independent verification and particularly have an auditing system in place. Those on the other side are stuck on two things: one is a closed loop system or something like a closed loop system and the second is an abattoir which might meet a particular standard. It is important that they do have a supply chain assurance in place.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of whether I was aware of particular systems being in place, the crux of the matter is: is there supply chain assurance in place with traceability, transparency and an accounting and verification process? If you adopted the policy of those on the other side, you would be sending cattle cruelly to markets without any assurance that they are—

           , on the point of order: Senator Ludwig was absolutely answering the question. He still has 29 seconds to complete his answer. There is tedious repetition. Senator Brandis's repeated points of order should be dismissed out of hand.

             The challenge is for those on the other side. There is no supply chain assurance in place for cattle leaving Australia, going into feedlots in Indonesia and going from feedlots into abattoirs that provides for traceability, accountability and independent auditing.

              , I ask a supplementary question. Since this Australian company can give that assurance of supply chain continuity, will the minister now allow the export of cattle under this closed system to resume immediately and thus avoid the dire consequences facing the Australian beef cattle industry?

               What we do know is this. When you look at the comments by Premier Barnett, he gave the game away. In terms of providing assurances in this regard, he admitted he could not provide any assurance that Australian cattle would be managed through the supply chain in line with international welfare standards. Mr Barnett admitted he had no basis for calling for the immediate resumption of trade other than his personal presumption that appropriate standards were in place. Mr Barnett of course knows the presumption is totally incorrect.
              </p>
              <p>
               In terms of being able to get trade up and running as early as possible, I have continually said to industry that there needs to be supply chain assurance in place that includes not only traceability, transparency and accountability but independent auditing at the conclusion of that. If there is one such body that can achieve that then they can talk to the department.
