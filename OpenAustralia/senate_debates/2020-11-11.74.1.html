         I thank Senator Hughes for that question and for her commitment to everybody in rural and regional Australia and particularly in

         </a>
         government remains absolutely committed to improving mobile phone coverage in rural and regional areas of Australia. Mobile phone coverage, as those on this side of the chamber absolutely get, is vital to people living, working and also travelling across regional and remote Australia. That's why this government has committed $380 million in our Mobile Black Spot Program. The first five rounds of the program have generated in private, government and community investment, $836 million, which is funded over 1,200 mobile base stations right across our nation. Of that, over 880 of these base stations have been activated, delivering real benefits now to regional and rural communities right across our nation. Today, there are 580 Telstra base stations that have enabled over 44,000 triple 0 emergency calls.
        </p>
        <p>
         The next round of the Mobile Black Spot Program is focused on testing different program designs to expand and also to improve regional and remote coverage. Our record stands in the starkest possible contrast to the record of those opposite who did not build a single black spot tower in their six years in government. Only a Morrison and McCormack government can deliver improved connectivity for regional and rural Australians.

            bushfires. Our investment in telecommunications resilience is a vital part of that investment. In May, the Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts announced a $37.1 million package to prevent, mitigate and manage telecommunications outages in emergencies, particularly bushfires.
           </p>
           <p>
            This package includes four key initiatives. Firstly, we are already strengthening the resilience of regional and remote telecommunication networks through mobile network hardening. Secondly, we are providing more deployable telecommunication infrastructure. Thirdly, we are providing better telecommunications for rural and country fire service depots and also for evacuation centres. Fourthly, we are raising community awareness about access to—

               Contrast what their government did—or not, as the case may be—with what we are now doing. This package is further strengthening the resilience of regional and remote telecommunications through mobile network hardening and more temporary deployable infrastructure.

               Co has already delivered the first Road Muster truck, along with the first satellite fly-away kit. Nationally, over 150 mobile sites funded through the first five rounds of the Mobile Black Spot Program are in bushfire prone or affected areas. Of these, 114 sites have already been built, which I am sure those opposite will be grateful to know. At Howes Valley, a new base station was switched on in January of this year. In March another station begins operation at McCullys Gap. These targeted investments are helping regional communities to better deal with emergencies—
