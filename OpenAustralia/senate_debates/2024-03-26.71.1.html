         Thank you, Senator Thorpe. Obviously, I'm not in a position to disclose announcements that the government may make in the context of this year's budget. Sitting this close to the Minister for Finance, it would be very dangerous to reveal those kinds of things! But certainly the government does acknowledge that there are some very real issues around legal aid funding, including to Aboriginal legal services in the way that you've described.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I understand it, the Attorney-General has commenced a review surrounding these issues. No doubt, once that review is completed, he will be in a position to say more about that, but what we are doing in the meantime is fulfilling an election commitment by designing and implementing the National Justice Reinvestment Program, which will provide $79 million to support community-led justice reinvestment initiatives. The government opened applications for the National Justice Reinvestment Program and the Justice Reinvestment in Central Australia Program in September 2023. In the first cycle—

                 Senator Thorpe, I have answered your questions by saying that we're not in a position to describe what will be included in this year's budget, whether it be in this space or any other space. We understand there are some very real issues in this area, and that is why we are undertaking this action. In the first cycle of the Justice Reinvestment Program, nine initiatives have been selected for funding, and applications remain open year-round. We are clearly committed to this by having already put in place $79 million to support those community-led justice reinvestment initiatives.

                    I don't think it is fair to accuse the Attorney-General of hiding a report that he only received three weeks ago. It's understandable that he and the government more broadly would take a little bit of time to consider the recommendations of that review before either releasing it or announcing what our response to that review will be.

                    The Albanese government recognises the pressures that these services are under, and we also recognise the importance of strengthening the legal assistance sector. We recognise that legal assistance is essential to ensuring access to justice and equality before the law for all Australians, including our

                    </a>
                    . That's exactly why the Attorney-General commissioned the review of the National Legal Assistance Partnership between the Commonwealth and all states and territories. This review report was received on 5 March, and it's now being considered by federal, state and territory attorneys-general.

                       It's obviously a matter for the Attorney-General to determine whether he will release this report and, if so, when that will occur. I'm not going to commit another minister to releasing a report by the end of this week, but the mere fact the Attorney-General has commissioned this independent review of the National Legal Assistance Partnership shows good faith on his part and shows that the Albanese government understands the pressures that Aboriginal legal services are under.

                       If my recollection serves me correctly, the Attorney-General himself has worked in Aboriginal legal services in the past.
